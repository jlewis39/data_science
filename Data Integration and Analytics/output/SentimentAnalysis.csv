","Aside from the location, this place has almost nothing going for it. We popped in for some quick pub food. I wasn't expecting much but how bad could a cheeseburger be? Ugh. The food was just bad. They must use the cheapest ingredients they can find. A simple cheeseburger was dry and stale tasting. Even the colas were oddly flat and syrupy. I would never go here again, even just for a quick bite. I can't attest to the drinking atmosphere but the food? HORRIBLE.",1,Negative
1,Johnny Rockets,"I saw Johnny Rockets featured on Undercover Boss last year and it inspired me to give the restaurant I have been passing ever since they opened this location a try. This must be some knock off because I didn't get the nostalgic Americana diner experience I had hoped for and was promised to me not only by the executive featured on the show but by a sign on the wall. This is more like an express Johnny Rockets. No full service, no fun friendly or singing staff. I mean, where was the juke box, the lunch counter, the black and white pics of teens at a sock hop? OK, so the atmosphere sucked. The food was just OK. I really don't like mayo AND mustard on my burger - it causes all the other stuff to slip around and it's just not the mess I need the street traffic on Lake and State to see as I eat ",2,Positive
2,Johnny Rockets,"My first experience involved me walking in and immediately walking right back out... But I came to find out they actually have a veggie burger after writing Johnny Rocket's. Veggie burger is fantastic, and so are the fries! Best of all - it's vegan! If you're not into mustard make sure to tell them to make it without cause they slather it on!",3,Positive
3,Johnny Rockets,"The last time I went to a Johnny Rocket was when there was one at the Rush and Division area, I'd get an awesome ham and cheese, fries and a chocolate malt- When the one opened on State was anxious to give it a try- The place is split b/t Halsted St. Deli and Johnny Rockets, I don't think they have everything on the menu like the old one did- I ordered a single cheeseburger and a chocolate malt-Let's just say I wasted $10 today-The cheeseburger was gross, I think McDonald's is better than this-It didn't have any taste, I mean nothing at all-The cheese was so gross, and the chocolate malt...well I couldn't taste the malt and where was the chocolate taste? So I will never go here again and will tell people to go to Portillo's for a nice thin and cheesy burger-",1,Negative
4,Johnny Rockets,"Oye vay. Where to start? High prices, small portions, and the sassy staff were all very disappointing. Yes, your burgers are fresh and tasty, but just not enough to make up for a less than mediocre restaurant. Sorry Johnny.",2,Negative
5,Johnny Rockets,"good location & great burgers: We stopped here for lunch and really enjoyed it here. My girl enjoyed her sandwich and it came hot & fresh. I ordered the St.Louis burger and it was out of this world. If you want a good burger that's the one to order,real good think sliced bacon plus cheese. We got the cheese fries too and they were great. This a little diner and we enjoyed it a lot.You can also eat your lunch and do some people watching off the streets.It was priced a little higher than other burger joints but it is something worthwhile to visit.",4,Positive
6,Johnny Rockets,"Note to self:  here is the URL to submit a complaint to the City of Chicago Dept of Public Health. http://www.cityofchicago… Oh boy.  Haven't had to give a 1 star rating in a while, but this one deserves it.  Keep in mind this location is nothing like what I remember from the real Johnny Rockets in other states.  What I mean is the interior is barely keeping up with the red and white color scheme, the tables and chairs seem random, the floors were sticky and not clean, there was no jukebox playing tunes from the 50s and 60s, and the entire ordering system is backwards from the real Johnny Rockets (table service, sitting at the bar counter to watch the kitchen and shakes being made, etc).  Not here.  But why? The location is amazing, right next to the big theatre sign that says CHICAGO on t",1,Negative
7,Johnny Rockets,"One word....AWFUL!!!!!! I even love burgers from 'greasy spoons', this burger didn't even come close to that. Do not bother.",1,Positive
8,Johnny Rockets,"If you're in the loop and need a quick and inexpensive burger fix, this will do.",3,Negative
9,Johnny Rockets,"I was super excited to see a Johnny Rockets in the loop, but disappointed to see that it was a limited menu.  The shakes and rings are still good and the chicken fingers are finger lickin good (pun intended).  The location is teeny tiny, so it can get crowded during peek lunch time hours, but they manage to get you in and out pretty quickly (sadly, we still have no In n Out in Chicago).",3,Negative
10,Johnny Rockets,Had a double cheeseburger. Really big portions but overall bland. It didn't really taste like much.,2,Negative
11,Johnny Rockets,"This place just opened up....whats going on with the food? What is wrong with Chicago....we aren't a little no name town that can't dish out good eats  (small towns probably have better food) !     I had the chili-cheese fries. I hadn't had this in over 10 years. I guess 10 years ago they tasted better than they do now! The fries were dry, the chili was canned, the cheese like butter. Overall the dish didn't please my eyes or my stomach. I stopped eating after a couple of fries. I could already see the outcome of finishing that muck. I gave this place 3 stars because they had a really nice grand opening, with a song + dance. I also had their strawberry shake, it was pretty damn good...cheaper than Potbelly's, so I'm sold! I'm willing to go back and try their chicken strips.....",3,Negative
12,Johnny Rockets,"It had been a very long day and our first night in Chicago. It's past 10PM and finding places on my list this late was no longer a priority for us. Just finished listening to the great Ramsey Lewis celebrate his 75TH birthday at the Millennium Park's Jay Pritzker Pavilion. Plus we were under dressed for the windy cold evening. On the way back to the Hotel Burnham we walk pass Johnny Rockets filled with customers. It looked clean and safe. Hey, at this time of night one has to make priorities. Either get something quick to eat or don't eat at all. Didn't realize that Johnny Rockets carried an Italian beef sandwich. So, we ordered the sandwich, American fries and their Smoke House Single to go. Got our order pretty quickly and dashed to our hotel room just a couple of blocks away. Turned on ",4,Positive
13,Johnny Rockets,"I love opening day of a new restaurant (or chain). You get a warm welcome at the door; the staff is excited; its picture perfect. Overall, things seem to be running smoothly so far. It's really hard to judge a book by its cover at this stage in the game though. Maybe I need to stop in a month from now at 12:00pm to see some chaos. The food is ok. The burger was good, and done quickly. The fries, however, I can't really say that I'm a fan of. I hate flimsy fries. What I don't understand is why this place shares a space with Halsted Street Deli. That is super weird and I can only imagine that when its busy, its going to be nightmare for people getting their drinks at the soda fountain. But maybe their timeliness with filling orders will keep that from happening. We shall see.",4,Positive
14,Johnny Rockets,"Lunch break.  hmmmm... I think I'll go for a burger.  I got a bun with what seemed like some kind of meat substance that must have been cooked 7 hours previous.  Seriously, the bun overlapped the burger by about an inch on all sides!  Secret sauce?  It tasted like a watered-down ketchup-mayo and cucumber mix?  Wha?  And every other fry was under cooked.  How does that even happen?",1,Negative
15,Jaffa Bakery,"Lots of food, good price, but my chicken fajita and rice was a bit greasy for my taste.",3,Negative
16,Jaffa Bakery,"Besides being in a dungeon, I really can't complain about this place.  The falafel sandwich is good, not great.  The chicken sandwich was also good.  The service is sweet, although confused on how to use a KGBdeal.  I wouldn't really come here that often because I like windows, but it's not bad if you want decent, cheap food.  I wanted some baklava but you know, the calories from the falafel fit my quota for the meal.  Anyway, I am sure it was delicious.",3,Positive
17,Jaffa Bakery,"There are turkey sandwiches and then there are Jaffa sandwiches. Once you have a turkey sandwich from Jaffa, deli sliced colds cuts sandwiches will seem like....well deli sliced cold cuts sandwiches. Its like the rest of man's great inventions Tivo, Ipods, cell phones, crack cocaine....once you try it, there's going back to life before you knew it. Real turkey, freshly baked and piping hot. It sits in its own juices, so its always moist and flavorful (I'm tempted to order one of their turkey's next thanksgiving, yes they are that good...).  A plethora (yes, plethora) of toppings to top things off as well: mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, tabouli, hummus, baba ganoush along with the usual sandwich accompaniments. I dare you to find that combo anywhere else.   Get the sandwich bun 'dipped' ",5,Negative
18,Jaffa Bakery,"The hunt for stellar hummus continues with my experience at Jaffa Bakery today. With three middle eastern food restaurants in a two block radius, the competition is definitely stiff in the south loop.   Though Jaffa may not be my favorite choice, the one thing I've always liked about this place is also unique to their shop - the falafel plate mix. This is the menu option if you like it all - babaganoush, falafel, grape leaves, tahini sauce, garden salad,  tabouleh, and of course, pita bread, all on one plate, all for $6.75. The nice thing is, if you like everything but one or two of the options, you have the option of cutting that out and substituting a bit more of something you do like. I've been here a few times now, and at first I was impressed with the serving size, the quality of the ",2,Negative
19,Jaffa Bakery,"Is that a 'gobble gobble' I hear in the back?   Probably not, but the turkey here at Jaffa seems to be so fresh and tender, the turkey might as well have just been enjoying life a few minutes ago.  Well, turkey, my tummy thanks you for your generosity at letting Jaffa take you and make me a delicious lunch! Prices here are inexpensive (around $6 for a turkey entree).  The food is healthy enough to make me feel good about what I'm eating and fatty enough to taste yummy!",4,Positive
20,Jaffa Bakery,"Nothing wrong here, just not what I was expecting I guess. To be clear - I have only visited for lunch. Perhaps I shall bagel soon. A bunch of guys from the office came to a lunch meeting with what appeared to be delicious Mediterranean food, and claimed to have gotten from THE VERY BUILDING our office is in. Score - maybe no more walking to Haifa? Well, it's not as Mediterranean (at least at lunch) as I thought. Their specialty seems to be turkey, which was good, as far as turkey goes. Several gents in the office are hooked on it - multiple visits a week. They have a good collection of sides too, mashed potatoes, corn, etc. Even cranberry sauce. So, I had the turkey platter - which was good, not out of the ordinary. It was a ton of food for not much money though - there's definite value h",3,Positive
21,Jaffa Bakery,"When you walk in your nose is bombarded with 3 different things. Dunkin Donuts coffee, Bacci's Pizza, and the tantalizing whiff of fresh made bagels. All of these things are cloistered in a small basement like space but luckily you can follow your nose to Jaffa. I've gone here a couple of times and the first thing I can say is that the people working are really nice. They listen to what you are saying and tailor your bagel or food to how you like it which is nice. They even let me pay in change (hey I'm poor what do you want). I've had the Mediterranean food and the bagels and my favorite is the warm soft bagels. Toasted they are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and with a good helping of cream cheese and veggies (I like tomato and onion mmm) it's one of the better places to gra",4,Positive
22,Jaffa Bakery,"Oh my, my, my. I am a fan of the turkey kabobs and mashed potatoes w/ the turkey gravy. My coworker is a fan of the falafel on pita. We visit this place at least every other week in the Illinois/Fox building. I did not think turkey could be so flavorful and juicy until I found this place.",4,Negative
23,Jaffa Bakery,Great turkey sammichez and chicken kabobs for a great price. You can't beat it!,4,Positive
24,Jaffa Bakery,"Turkey sandwich was excellent.  Wish they had stuffing to go on top so i could have had it with cranberry sauce.  They didnt, so i went with mustard/mayo/lettuce/tomato/cheese.  It was excellent, but it would have been more so with cranberry and stuffing.",3,Negative
25,Jaffa Bakery,"I come here a few times a week because it's such a close walk from my office and they are pretty quick. $2 for bagel and cream cheese. They have tons of bagels and cream cheeses to choose from, my favorite is a toasted onion or garlic bagel with chive cream cheese. I just went here to get lunch the other day for the first time and got a half dark half white meat turkey sandwich on a french roll with 'the works'. It's real turkey too, that giant carcass just lies in front of ya waiting for you to devour it. They also have tons of juices and smoothies, but I find that it takes long compared to how fast they get food out. $4+ to use plastic. There is some seating, but it seems cramped in there, but I usually just bring it back to my office - and make sure my co workers catch a whiff of that t",4,Negative
26,Jaffa Bakery,"It's a little misleading to say I'm a fan, but I do default to eating lunch here quite a bit given that I work in this building. Their bagels aren't bad but I actually quite like their fruit cup, which is quite fresh and reasonably priced too. They have freshly-squeezed OJ, which I crave sometimes. But I recommend against their smoothies. The staff here is a little, umm, odd.. Quick Tip: They do not accept AmEx and Visa/MC is only accepted above $4.",4,Positive
27,Jaffa Bakery,"If this review ends abruptly, it's because I fell asleep after eating their wonderful turkey sandwich. They have REAL freshly made turkey sandwiches (they bake and hand carve Turkeys daily).. You can pick white or dark meat, or both.  You can pick to put it on a roll, bagel, sub, etc.  You can pick from a number of toppings (I go for the very messy dijon, mayo, cranberry, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato combination).. They have a $6+tax turkey sandwich+drink+chips.  I always get a sandwich, chips, and banana instead. Hard to beat this deal! They also have falafel and skewers but I've never tried",5,Negative
28,Jaffa Bakery,"Nothing better than grabbing a giant, fresh out of the oven, bagel and cream cheese for $1.75.   Although I have encountered a line on a few occasions, the great staff keeps it moving pretty quickly.  Good selection of bagels and spreads as long as you are there before 10am.  Otherwise, you get the leftovers and it doesn't feel as fun.",4,Positive
29,Jaffa Bakery,"I pop into Jaffa whenever I work in the 'Concourse', a.k.a. the 225 W. Wacker building. This is one of those places that has a sort of limited menu, but everything they do is done well. Bagels and coffee - with a smile and a flirt! Turkey sandwiches - seem to be their specialty, what with the giant carcass of the unwitting bird on display - yuuuuummy and giant. Juice bar - nice, and hard to find a no-frills one like this, v. nice.",3,Positive
30,Jaffa Bakery,"Any bagel, any cream cheese = $2 even. The jalapeño cheddar, toasted, with smoked salmon cream cheese is my favorite. The bagel tasted fresh, the cream cheese had little flakes of salmon (not pureed to a uniform pink). I've probably already exhausted everything I can say about this bagel. Summary: it was tasty, and cost me $2. Unless you work in the 225/233 N. Michigan Ave building, or use the pedway to pass through it, you won't spot this from the street. If you enter through the revolving doors under the large red awning, go up the escalators and make a left past Starbucks.",4,Negative
31,Jaffa Bakery,"I come here nearly every day for a breakfast bagel and cream cheese.  The staff gets easily overwhelmed because the ordering system needs some adjustments, but they work hard and at least twice a week I leave a $1 tip. However, I find the $4 minimum totally annoying.  While apparently such minimums are (as of recent legislation) no longer illegal, I think they are a bad policy when you have a daily customer who pays cash day after day.  Only twice in almost a year of going to Jaffa bagel every weekday morning have I asked to use my debit card for the $2 transaction.  This morning, the reason I only had $1 in my wallet was because I gave Jaffa bagel employees a $1 tip yesterday! The manager readily accommodated my request this time, but the counter employees seemed flustered by my request t",4,Negative
32,Jaffa Bakery,"Wow. I have to say, this place really surprised me. Looking at the reviews I was a bit skeptical. I don't know what's up with all the 'bad customer service' comments here but I got treated pretty dang good and it was busy. So no complaints about that from me.. Now onnnnn to the good stuff. Prices are pretty decent for being a downtown spot. Everything here was pretty fresh looking. I ordered the turkey sandwich on a kaiser roll. Mix of white and dark meat for me, please. Cranberry sauce, swiss cheese. Oh, yum. The sandwich was sooooo fresh and that turkey. Oh, the turkey. Better than my Momma's thanksgiving bird. Juicy & flavorful.

35,Jaffa Bakery,Amazing bagels and delicious cream cheese for only $2??? What's not to love?! Seriously fantastic breakfast food and their lunch sandwiches are out of this world ... do yourself a favor and go to Jaffa!,5,Positive
36,Jaffa Bakery,"Two things you should know about Jaffa Bagels: 1, it's kind of hard to find.  If you stand on Michigan Avenue, you will not be able to see it.  Even if you walk into the lobby of the building numbered 225/205 Michigan Avenue, you will not be able to see it.  Only if you ascend the escalator, turn left, and start walking down a hallway past the Starbucks will you see it.  Which brings us to . . . . 2, it doesn't open until 11 a.m.  I understand that in Chicago, bagel beggars can't be choosers, but aren't there many people who consume bagels for breakfast?  I really would have thought so.  Luckily, the Dunkin' Donuts down the hall was open, so we went there.",2,Negative
37,Jaffa Bakery,"Ever since I started my new job across the street, hardly a day has gone by without one of my coworkers mentioning / raving about / drooling over the deliciousness that is Jaffa.  I'd tried the bagels (yummy, piping hot, and fast!), but i had not yet tried the famous turkey sammich- until today!  Oh boy is it tasty!  It's everything they said it was and more- a French roll piled high with plump hunks of real turkey and my choice of condiments.  This lunch spot gets extra points in my book for not immediately asking if I want 'mayo, mustard, hot peppers' on my sandwich.",4,Negative
38,Jaffa Bakery,"I agree that the falafel is good, but the hot turkey sandwich is really good so I've been eating lunch here a lot. As Mike says it's very fresh tasting. The good thing about it is that it's a pretty cheap meal option as well.",4,Positive
39,Jaffa Bakery,"I've been searching for 'the one': the mythical falafel sandwich in the loop that has been prophecized to slay hunger and deliver deliciousness to the beautiful princess (me), who's been trapped in the tower with the evil Corner Bakery for many bleak, weary wintery months. Other falafel sandwiches have tried and come up short- falafels too gritty, wrong/goopy combination of toppings, too far away from the office, etc.   I've passed by this place many times on my quest (it's easy to miss- downstairs with the Roma Pizza and Dunkin Donuts), although today was the first time that our paths crossed.  I asked the Oracle if this falafel sandwich might be the one (read: I ate it).  The answer: this is not the one.  However, with the right amount of training (use a thicker pita that does not fall a",3,Negative

It's fast and affordable...I usually take it back to the office since the food court area is pretty gross and I'd rather not eat there!",4,Negative
41,Jaffa Bakery,the turkey theme is weird. The falafel sandwich is barely passable and the veggie plate is ok. i go here on those cold days where i can walk across the walkway and pick up a bite without having to dress up to go outside.

ALL of my credit card information, name, address ect, were stolen to make a fraudulent XBOX live account, which charged 74.99 to my debit card. The reason that I suspect that is was someone employed at this location, is this account was created and closed the same evening of my Jimmy John's order.  The reason I suspect that it is someone employed at this location, is because it is the only instance that someone would have had access to not only my credit card infor",1,Negative

I walked in a 11:40am and it was empty, so I figured I could get a little work done while I ate. Since there was no one there, I got my sandwich before my credit card was even processed and I took my seat to be surprised there is no wifi in the restaurant. Sandwich was good (they piled on the sprouts) and great for a quick eat, but if you are going there for wifi....no dice.",3,Negative
46,Jimmy Johns,"WTF Jimmy John??? Your sandwiches suck, that's WTF! Not that the sandwiches taste bad, but for $6 I got a ham sandwich that I could have made at home for $.75. The sandwich was cold the bread was hard and it had more lettuce than ham. And don't get me started on the fact that you guys don't supply pickles!!! I gave Jimmy Johns and extra star because, like the commercials state, they are fast. Minus one star for the surly service. Yea, I hate my job too, but suck it up because customers don't care if you hate you job or not. Forgive me Potbelly's for my indiscretion, I will never stray again!",2,Negative
47,Jimmy Johns,"There is nothing wrong with this particular Jimmy Johns. I just am not a fan of Jimmy Johns in general. The only thing that Jimmy Johns has going for it is the speed with which they make the sandwiches. They slop that meat and bread together in seconds. Amazing. Then you bite into the sandwich and it is far from amazing. If I want a cold sandwich, I'll go to Subway. At subway I get to choose from tons of toppings (olives, peppers, cucumbers...yum) and I get oil and vinegar as well. If I want a really good sandwich, I'll go to Pastoral or Goodwin's. There's just nothing special about Jimmy Johns. Potbelly's is superior to Jimmy Johns. At Potbelly's I can get delicious shakes and my beloved oatmeal cookies. To each his own. Jimmy Johns just isn't for me.",3,Positive
48,Jimmy Johns,"I loves me a Vito with mayo and Thinny Chips.  My absolute favorite lunch cheat on Weight Watchers.  Totally worth the inflated prices of JJ's for the bread alone -- finally a sub roll with decent crust and good chewiness in a chain restaurant.     What I don't love is the inconsistency of this location (and attitude!) when I go there in off hours.  Like 2:30 pm-ish today for example.  Kinda wack but it seems like the food and service is way better during the 11 am - 1 pm crowded lunch time.  You're in, you're out, you're on your way.  The order comes out perfect every time.   Not so at 2:30 pm when you are the ONLY person in the store.  Attitude out the yin-yang for wanting two sandwiches (one for me, one for co-worker who loves him a no-onion Vito easy on the mayo) rung up separate.   Sa",2,Positive
49,Jimmy Johns,"This is not a dig to this particular store, but a beef that I have with Jimmy Johns in general.  Where are the freaking pickles? I'm astounded by this. It keeps me up at night. I'm convinced that Jimmy John's is just a front for a spy organization that will be the demise of us all, because we all know it's un-American to serve a sub without pickles. And a big fat pickle on the side is NOT the same.  What am I supposed to do- lob an entire half pickle on my sandwich?  If you ask me, it's adding insult to injury.  Because you know they have pickles there but they won't slice them right.   Otherwise their sandwiches are dece, but I'm too busy flying into a fit of rage every time I get one because they don't have pickles!!!   I think I should go lie down now.   xoxo",3,Negative

Our group of three could not find a table at lunch, sadly. At least it was a nice day and we could take our Beach Clubs (with barely any avocado) to go! There are two lines, and each line has its own sandwich-making station.

Today, I ordered my sandwich online. Quick and easy! There are also vegetable choices here (cucumber, sprouts) that I never think of getting in the store (where I often have to repeat my order four times and forget stuff).

She asked to be let into the building and I told her I couldn't and she had to call the person on the intercom to be buzzed up.

Then she asked to use a cell phone to call back to Jimmy johns to get more info. Number one, where is your cell phone?

A week or so later I had Jimmy John's for the second time (sober) and wow. Amazing. Sure, I can compare & contrast this place to Subway, but I'm not going to do that. I don't think it compares. Different types of bread, ingredients, & over-all taste.  You're able to get your sandwich on deli-type french bread or normal sandwich-sliced bread. Both ways are great. I love that this place isn't skimpy with the fixin's. If you want extra cheese, they' won't complain & whine about having to add more to the sandwich they are already making. They'll do what is asked & best of all: be extremely quick about it. Wam bam thank you Jimmy John's.",4,Positive

ALL of my credit card information, name, address ect, were stolen to make a fraudulent XBOX live account, which charged 74.99 to my debit card.

62,Jimmy John's,"I've never really understood the fascination with Jimmy John's... Their sandwiches are OK but I've never been blown away, and most of the sandwiches I've had I've found to be kind of bland.   And they nickel and dime to death. Today I had the best one I've ever had probably--the Italian Night Club...   It's Italian cuts of meat on...French bread though?  well, I should say what they call French--the real French would be appalled at it though.  It actually reminds me a lot of what Subway's bread used to be.  (I do know that their bread contains no high fructose corn syrup, which is more than Subway can claim). The Vito is a more stripped down version, taking out some of the meats...  it is decent though tastes nothing like a real Italian sub. The menu encourages you to order peppers with it",2,Negative

65,Jimmy John's,"This is one of the smaller JJ locations, but they still sport the same menu and speedy service. Same yummy sandwiches that I like at the other locations. If you're gonna franchise it for a downtown lunch, JJ's is a reasonable and healthy option at least. The sandwiches are reliably delicious. They beat Subway all to hell. This location, unbeknownst to many, is also the 'gay disco' JJ's, as the beats were pumpin' when I ate lunch today. It made me want to eat really fast, and rush back to my office to get a lot of work done. Except wait, I don't have an office to rush back to. Everyone in the place was hot, and well dressed. Then, Zohan entered, and cut my hair into a strangely flattering circa 1986 haircut. I looked seelky smooth. Then, this poontüchen and her hot IDF master anti-terror op",4,Positive

67,Jimmy John's,"So, I decided to write a review for Jimmy John's for one reason, and one reason only, THE TUNA! Now, if you're anything like me, you're quite afraid to purchase/try tuna from any place other than your mom's kitchen (or your own for that matter). However, on one particular day, when I was in Milwaukee for work, I decided to try, Jimmy John's Tuna because I am friggin tired of the Turkey Tom with Provolone. So, that tuna in Milwaukee was quite yummy. Just plain ol delicious. So, on another occasion, hungry and still friggin tired of the Turkey Tom with Provolone, I decided to eat this tuna again. Once again, it was yummy. What I enjoy about Jimmy John's tuna is it's not too mayonnaise-y. I mean, I really hate the stuff. Have you ever seen the movie, 'Undercover Brother'? Well, that's how I f",4,Negative
68,Jimmy John's,"A great no-nonsense decent sandwich and super fast!  I know JJ is always fast, but this location is nuts, EVERY TIME I order it is done by the time I put my change back in my wallet... it blows my mind.  The bread is tasty as ever too.",4,Negative
69,Jimmy John's,"What is there new to say about a Jimmy Johns? Basically they've reached their upper limit, so the only reason to say anything bad about JJs is if there's something sub par compared to every other JJs in the world. There's nothing sup par for this one. I am amazed at how fast these guys can throw together a sandwich, though, but that's there job right? So I guess it's nothing that impressive. There's an older lady that works here which is incredibly un-JJs like to me. So that's cool to see if you come here! Only one set of doors to the outside can make it cold when it's cold, if you're eating-in. That's pretty much it. It's Jimmy John's. You get what they advertise and this place follows through.",4,Negative
70,Jimmy John's,"I'm normally a fan of JJ's--great bread, fresh ingredients, quick service, particularly at this location.  And I love that they have spicy chips. But the extra charge for hot peppers has got to go.  Today I paid $ .45 for 3 (yes, 3) peppers.  that's 15 cents a pepper!   Potbelly's and Subway add them at no charge--and they both have giardineira, which is a staple for me. I'll have to ask for them on the side next time--maybe I'll get more.  Will keep you posted.",2,Negative
71,Jimmy John's,"Huge fan of JJ's ever since Subway made me sick *gags* Well living in the burbs and now working downtown I have noticed all types of price differences....I mean come on 6.00 for one sandwich without any mayo or anything on it?! Are you kidding me, I mean in the West they are only 3.99 at the same chain! I swear its not JJ's that I am faulting but moreso the Loop.....Blame the LOOP for those three stars dammit",3,Negative
72,Jimmy John's,"I know there is nothing 'special' about the Jimmy John's sandwiches, but they are always fresh and fast and that is a lot to ask for in the Loop.  I love this location because the people are really friendly and know what I am talking about when I say I want the 'California' (I am terrible about remembering the names of things)  I don't think $5 for a sandwich that I like is a lot of money - I am more put off by the crappy ones at WolfGang Puck's cafeteria at the Graham School that masquerade as 'gourmet' and are atrocious and cost $7.",4,Negative
73,Jimmy John's,"the only reason they get three stars is because i love jimmy john's. but this one, right across from where i work, doesn't always serve well. i notice that the workers are much more efficient when it's busy and take their time when i'm the only one there. not that i mind waiting for my sandwich, but don't they want to impress me with their sandwich making skills. and furthermore, i get a beach club faster than i get a turkey without tomatoes and mayo. that makes no sense. it's not a bad location, it just makes me wonder.",3,Positive
74,Jimmy John's,"4 stars. . . because for some reason at this location, my sweater doesn't end up smelling like nasty cheese after I leave.

75,Jimmy John's,Jimmy Johns is an oasis of normalcy when you're at a conference at the Hilton on South Michigan. Just two blocks of freezing your ass off and you can have yourself a lovely sub sandwich instead of eating 'hotel food.' Doooo it.,4,Negative
76,Jimmy John's,"Of all the Jimmy John's locations I've been to, this is probably my favorite.  The staff here is very friendly and personable, very fast and always making sure that things are clean and orderly.  Their sandwich construction is tops (sandwich construction is very important to me).  The price here is pretty middle-of-the-road compared to other locations in the area (I mean we're only talking a difference of like 30 cents, but still).  My only gripe is that they don't have yellow/banana peppers.",5,Positive
77,Jimmy John's,"I would normally give a sandwich place of this quality a 3 rating. Solid menu choices and you can customize as you like. +1 for having the 'un-wich' menu item, an 8' lettuce wrap instead of bread, for us people doing the low-carb thing.",4,Negative

80,Jimmy John's,"Oh Jimmy John's, how I love you. While everyone is busy in love with celebrities like Zac Efron and Justin Timberlake, I am in love with Jimmy John. Everytime I walk into Jimmy John's, I order the Turkey Tom with no sprouts. Some people like alfalfa sprouts, but I do not recommend it because most people do not like it. However, the sprouts are good for you. I even buy the loaves of bread to go home and make my own version of the Jimmy John's sandwich because the sandwiches are quite expensive if I buy them everyday. Aaaaahhhh, I love Jimmy John.",5,Positive
81,Jimmy John's,"Nothing exciting, nothing offensive: that's Jimmy John's!  This one has nothing terrible going on, other than you order at the front of the restaurant in front of the door, so if there's a line it's annoying because you're in everyone's way. Otherwise, no gripes.",3,Negative

83,Jimmy John's,"This particular JJ's really does operate by their motto (subs so fast you'll freak).  It was a regular lunchtime spot for my co-workers and me, and once you have 'regular' status they'll know you by name and have your sandwich waiting basically the second you walk in the door.   Service here is really good especially for a fast food place.  They're all so friendly and have great attitudes, especially the Steve lookalike (of SATC).",4,Positive
84,Jimmy John's,"Two blocks from my office. Had my sammich in about 60 seconds.   Everything is fresh and crisp. If I had to literally live on bread alone for the rest of my life, it would have to be Jimmy John's fesh bread. 'Nough said.",5,Negative
85,Jimmy John's,"this Jimmy John's gets 5 stars for service. they rock. i walk in and get greeted by 2 people, one at the counter and one in the back. every customer got a 'Hello! Welcome!' and a 'Thanks for coming! Have a great day!!!' and, of course, the sandwiches are good too!",5,Positive
86,Jimmy John's,"I'm not going to lie, I actually prefer JJ's to PB's.  I support the double digit sandwiches across the board, on all issues the 7-grain bread is quite filling, making for a delightful one-course meal.  I like the use of alfalfa sprouts and avocado spread, very neocentric.  A bit pricey but in the middle of the afternoon you won't have to be reaching for that 3:30pm snickers or stealing various candies off your co-workers desk when they go to the bathroom, but if you still want to... go for it tiger.  Lines get long so get there early because each sandwich is spread with care before it is wrapped in white paper and sent to a better home.  Seating is scarce, so I suggest you sit on the floor.",4,Negative
87,Jimmy John's,"JJ had me at first bite, when they opened up shop at the UIllinois campus in Champaign.  They handed out free sandwiches for a week and I was addicted.  I prefer it to Subway and Potbelly's, even though I think Subway is a better deal. I always get the Beach Club on wheat and I'm never disappointed.  Their wheat bread is super soft and filling.  Avocado + Sprouts = Crazy Delicious.  Always goes great with the Jalapeno chips, too. Line seems long, but moves quickly.  Nice staff, but make sure you know what you want/don't want on your sandwich before it's made in a flash.  Or you'll get some nasty looks. =)   Good luck finding a place to sit.  I always get my sandwich to go.",4,Positive
88,Jimmy John's,"Good food - can't complain there, but if you're going to make it in the Chicago lunch rush, you have to be able to handle a crowd better than this location.  Potbelly's could move through 3 times the customers they had in the time I waited in line.  But yeah, I'll be back because it's Jimmy John's and it's close to work.  Just might want to bring a snack for the line.",3,Negative
89,Jimmy John's,"Fastest. Jimmy John's. Ever. I walked in at lunchtime today to grab a #4 (Turkey Tom), and while there are dividers set up to keep an organized line during the lunch rush, there was no line. The people here are so quick that one couldn't form. If I hadn't seen them make my sandwich, I would have assumed there was a big pile of pre-made sandwiches back there, because it was ready about .35 seconds after I finished paying. This Jimmy John's has gotten more popular recently, so there's usually a bit of a line. However, it's a really fast line. I've run in here with only 4 minutes to grab a sammich and sprint to the office, and still made it to work on time. They're generous with the sprouts, too. This makes me happy.",4,Positive
90,Jimmy John's,"I love Jimmy John's. Except for this one. I just moved to an office next door to this location, and they absolutely suck. Of the four times I've eaten there, my order has been wrong every time. And today I even asked them to double check that it was right and it was STILL wrong! I think it's because no one who works there speaks English. And the worst part is that every time I've been there I have been the only person in the place (1:30-2:00ish). From now on I am going to walk the few extra blocks to the new JJ's on Adams & Clinton.",1,Negative
91,Jimmy John's,Jimmy John's is really fast.. just like they claim.  They also have tasty sandwiches.. but I think the taste of the sandwich relies too heavily on mayo.  I am trying to eat healthier.. so I try not to eat here anymore.  It's just not figure friendly. I do like the Beach Club and Italian Night Club if I feel like having a mayo guilty pleasure. Oh.. but one really good thing about them is that they offer day old bread for like 50 cents... or something cheap like that.  You can't beat that!  Way cheaper than the grocery store.,3,Positive
92,Jimmy John's,"#8 Billy Club, #10 Hunter's Club and #15 Club Tuna are my favorites. JJ's is one those places that is so hard to resists and this outlet does a great job of keeping my religious craving coming back for more. why 3 stars, for one they sometime screw up my order and the delivery service is never on time.",3,Negative
93,Jimmy John's,"$4.69 for the #3 (Totally Tuna) or the #6 (Vegetarian). Tuna's a little watery but very good, and I love the Veggie, even if their avocado 'spread' is barely noticeable. The bread is so fresh - and I am NOT a bread lover - and I love any sandwich with some sprouts thrown on.  (Oh, to live in CA and be able to get avocado/sprout sandwiches regularly!) I'm just really confused as to why 1) they cannot cut the sandwich in half, even if you ask them to, and 2) they cannot put the sandwich in a bag for you, even if you say it's to go.",4,Positive
94,Jimmy John's,"This location just opened last week and so far everytime I walk by it's been pretty packed. I couldn't decide where I wanted to go for lunch, I knew I wanted a sandwich but my favorite sandwich places were all outside and it was just too cold for me to venture outside. Anyways, the line wasn't too bad when I got inside and it went fairly quickly. I ordered my sandwich and it was ready in less than a minute. The sandwich itself was very good. My only problem was that it cost me $6.71! And I only got the sandwich, no chips, no drink. As much as I enjoy their sandwiches I can take my $6.71 down to Brian's or the Deli across the street and get a huge sandwich, bag of chips and a drink! But when it's snowing or too cold outside I guarantee I will be back at Jimmy John's.",3,Positive
95,Jimmy John's,"i had to repeat my order a few times but they got it right. avoid this place from 1215-1 as it gets super busy for lunch...unless of course you want jimmy john's for lunch at 1230, then by all means, go, however you'll wait a few extra minutes.",3,Negative
96,Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches,"Pros: Fast service, friendly staff, fresher than subway, cheap delivery, quite a few choices and good chips. Cons: No pickles to put on your sub and you have to buy a ginormous pickle (don't forget to ask them to slice it, or you will be in quite a situation), no wheat buns, not the best quality lunch meat, nothing toasted, not open late enough at this location for those of us that work late or have night classes.  AND they don't have yellow mustard!  What is this, New York?  Please.

The service for the most part was great, except for that one time our server seemed to hover a little too much. No big, though. The food and atmosphere are both pretty fun, and there are plenty of TV's to keep the sport fans entertained. Very fun spot, I am definitely going back and would recommend that you do too!",4,Positive

Jimmy green's was just the place! Great drinks specials (5 dollar UV vodka) and located in a safe neighborhood which was in walking distance from the red line. For food, we shared the mac and cheese special, chicken ceaser wrap, and a burger. Also a side order of sweet potato tots which were awesome! Overall, nothing fancy, yet really reasonable priced menu for good drinks and food. Will be back :)",4,Positive
105,Jimmy Green's,"This is definitely a great spot to watch a game.  My husband and I went there to have dinner, grab a few beers and watch the game.  We really liked this place because there were tv's everywhere- we can literally watch the game from every angle.  Although we sat at a table, it was very cool to see that each booth had its very own tv as well. The food was pretty good and they had a wide selection of beer.  The ambiance was fun and energetic; and the music was great.  In addition, the service was attentive. Last but not least, I really like that there is ample parking (pay for parking on the street, or $6 dollar parking lot around the corner). Going back soon!",4,Positive
106,Jimmy Green's,"This is a great neighborhood bar for those in the Printers Row area.  If you love sports, look no further.  They have TV's in view from about every seat in the place.  The food and drink selection is, in a word, immense.  I dare you to order the loaded fries and finish them, I dare you.  The staff is friendly and tries to ensure you have a good visit.",4,Positive

Prices are extremely reasonable and the beer list rocks.  I tried an oatmeal stout and a banana bread beer which actually tasted delicious-and just like it's name.  Sounds crazy but sooo worth it. All the food is served in HUGE portions which is incredibly generous considering the low prices.  We tried a 'side' of waffle fries served in a massive bowl and completely amazing.

They have huge awesome salads and they don't get mad about substitutions. I've only eaten here once so far though. Everyone elses food looked and smelled good too.

They have nicer things like Lindemanns Framboise and La Fin Du Monde, and they also have stuff like Old Style and Schlitz for folks who just want a cheap brew. I have had a burger both times I've been and both burgers were really good. They let you customize it any way you like, with various cheeses, bacon, and a lot of veggies in addition to the usual tomato and lettuce. A couple different sauces as well.

It's nice if you're sitting next to each other, but if there's a large group of you, you might not be able to hear everyone.

Tons & tones of flat-screen TVs on literally every wall and column in the place.  I don't think you there's a seat in the house that you can't see at least five TVs.   Next the beer the selection is awesome! Everything from local & national craft beers to a huge selection on imports and specialty imports...only drawback, not enough on tap...but this is plenty on tap.  Plus they had a couple of drink specials running with premium liquor, can't beat that!

122,Jimmy Green's,"I was inspired to host a Monday-night Bears game party in late December 2010, but not at my home. I walk a lot, so I may randomly dip into anything that looks  'new to me'. I spotted Jimmy Green's on south State St., took a 5-second look around, liked what I saw, and snatched a menu. I read the menu on the L and was impressed with the food options. It seemed like some effort was being made to provide interesting food for reasonable prices (as in a near-downtown value). So, it was the first place that came to mind for the party. After some e-mailing, a reservation was made. I got there a couple of hours early and Jeff was very accommodating to change the seating plan to fit my needs. I had asked for a booth, but there wasn't one large enough to allow my entire party to see the main screen e",4,Positive
123,Jimmy Green's,"Not your average sports bar. The decor is a modern look (the owners are in construction so know what they are doing) for a sports bar and have comfortable booths. They have a sh*t ton of beer selections (go for something not on tap) that are seasonal and most of which taste great. Every Monday during Bears' season (except when the Bears play on Monday Night Football), they have a former Bear player come in to sign autographs and take pictures. It is a GREEEEEAT place for Monday Night football then. They also have a wide food selection for a sports bar. Burgers are delicious and the fries are tasty.",4,Positive
124,Jimmy Green's,I have been to JW twice and each time the service and food left me feeling blue after it was all said and done. Our server said to sit anywhere we like. Ok...does that mean once we are seated if we are not in an area that has a server assigned that we are left to go back and make the food ourselves? We had to go back and ask after waiting 20 mins can someone take our order. Our server finally arrived and the food well was cold. I ordered a Tilapia sandwich which looked great but was cold. I sent it back and it seemed like it had been just popped in the microwave and it tasted like it. I figured OK they were having an off day so lets try this again. We sat in whats considered the 'Bar' area and not the booths. It was a Bears game so it was a bit crowded but not enough for yet again terrible,1,Positive
125,Jimmy Green's,"As I promised..and update...so I went here on a Saturday night around 8pm, some of the NBA playoff games were on, and this place was pretty packed..not to the point where you couldn't move, but most tables were full and the place had a decent noise buzz (unlike the Monday night that I visited last).  This time we had food..and I must say, I was quite impressed.  The eggplant sandwich is super tasty (messy but really good), and the caprese sandwich was also awesome.  The sweet potato tater tots are like an appetizer and dessert all in one.  The beer list is awesome, and they have table toppers where they can give you a your own pourer of beer for the table, needless to say the guys loved this.  Plenty of TVs, pretty decent service, clean and friendly.  This place is fantastic!",5,Positive
126,Jimmy Green's,"Eh.  It wasn't awful, but the way they hype up their burgers, they're very forgettable.  Waitress screwed up my drink order about three times, and it was just beers.  It wasn't too far off, as she'd get the family of brands right, such as Sam Adams, but if I asked for a Noble Pils, a Boston Lager would return.  It really didn't bother me too much and became a kind of fun game of what she would return with.  If I lived nearby, I could see myself going here as my local, but since I'm a few miles away, I likely won't return.",3,Negative
127,Jimmy Green's,"Where else you gonna go in the south loop? South Loop Club? I hope not!!! This place is way better with solid food, decent drink prices, and great weekday lunch specials! The decor is very cool. The place was done right. Went here on game day for a bears game and had a great time. They've got free wifi so you can keep up with your fantasy league without totally killing your iPhone battery. In the summer they open up their windows. If you need to mix things up from kaseys, bar Louie, blackies, or the hack... This is your spot! Oh yea.. Waffle fries...",4,Positive

129,Jimmy Green's,"If you eat there, everything is fine. The staff is helpful and friendly with a wicked sense of humor. But,  takeout wasn't so hot. Eating in or carrying out, the beer battered onion rings are a must. Simply necessary. Bun was over toasted, steak ordered medium rare came out medium well on the steak sandwich. The fries are really good and the chicken finger wrap was really tasty. Should have known that a burger may not be the best option for takeout, though, and it was a mess. Rare instead of medium rare and the bun was soggy.  This probably wouldn't have happened if we ate there.  I guess Jimmy Greens has great appetizers and awesome sides, but I'm still looking for an entree to love.",3,Positive
130,Jimmy Green's,"As sports bars go, this place is good.  And desperately needed in the South Loop area.  However, my last trip here was just so-so.   The food portions are huge.  I think most people would love this, but I'm completely tired of this fad.  You don't impress me by giving me more than triple the appropriate serving size.  You would impress me by using fresh ingredients that speak for themselves.  But again, it's a sports bar, it's pretty much on par with the type of food you'll get at any other sports bar (read: everything covered is some type of mystery 'ranch' sauce).   The beer selection IS great.  Thank you for carrying more than the standard yellow bubbly piss (read: any of the Bud products). Ask for a table in the back.  Anywhere near the door and you will freeze in the winter.  The poor",3,Negative
131,Jimmy Green's,"We went in tonight with a group of 7 after a softball game for some food and drinks. Our waitress was nice but was really dang slow with our bill. Seriously, she dropped it off and didn't come back until one of us went to find her. This was like 15 minutes or so. The food was alright. Everyone in my party got the burger special which was $4.95 burgers with fries and $1 topping. One person's order got messed up, it was 'well done' when he asked for 'medium.' It was also missing a topping. Then it came back out like 2 minutes later with the topping on there so we assume that they sent out the same 'well done' burger. This was notified to the waitress and she comped the burger. The other burgers were almost all there, cooked as ordered but still, everyone said it was kind of dry. My sister sa",3,Positive

133,Jimmy Figs,Jimmy gets 2 stars for decent looking staff. BUT... Jimmy should be some more steak on his nachos for $11.95. Jimmy should clean his bathrooms. Jimmy should get rid of the karaoke. Jimmy should wash his wine glasses. Jimmy should change the cheesy decor.,2,Negative
134,Jimmy Figs,"This place is unspeakably dull. Why would anyone want to go to--let alone frequent--a drab bar with a handful of boring beers and dreadful food? Oh I know. Jimmy Figg's parades their servers around in the skimpiest of clothing to confuse the modern consumer into thinking it a Loop hotspot. Pay no mind to the man behind the curtain! Look at the juggs and tail! But I am a man of iron resolve. Temptations of the flesh will not sway me. I am here to Yelp and, damnit, that's what I'm going to do. First up, food. Nary a menu item compels you to say,'I gues I wouldn't mind that.' Bad offerings all around. I gave in and ordered a panini.

135,Jimmy Figs,"How genius is it that a bar sets up a game of bags INSIDE the bar?!  I think it's pretty genius. I'm reticent to tell you all this because when I go there on Fridays, I want to play, and there's only space for one set.  But, I'm feeling bighearted today, so I'll share.   My buddy and I went for lunch and split the nachos and chicken fingers. Nachos were the 'special' at half-price, only $4. It was a huge order, but also looks better from a distance. Toppings were very skim, probably because it was the 'special'. So... NOT special. I like their chicken fingers quite a bit.  Other food is decent, don't expect too much, and it's best to stick to simple things. It's a bar. I'd say it's a pretty legit lunch if I can play bags, watch the PGA Championship while also watching some ribbon gymnastic",3,Positive
136,Jimmy Figs,"I never knew about this place until my boyfriend asked me to meet him.  It's not too far from home so I was game.   Yes, this is a union bar mixed in with some 'ties'.  It is pretty lively mid-week to Friday.  I really appreciate how well I am treated by the bartenders.  They are always very pleasant and friendly to me.  In fact everyone has always been very  courteous and the guys offer up their seats. I never paid attention to what we were paying for my drinks, I just learned it is $10 a glass for cabernet.  I thought it was a bit much but hey, it's the city. I've never eaten here so I can't help there.  Overall I enjoy stopping in for a few and will continue to do so.  PS, their washrooms are very clean which is really important.",4,Positive

139,Jimmy Figs,"I'm told that this is a pretty good after work spot, compared to the elitism of other bars in the Loop, but during a recent trip after work, I really didn't see what was notable about the place. Standards sports fare on TV (which is really boring when there's nothing but ESPN talk shows without the sound), limited beer selection (the 'non-mainstream' beers on tap are Guinness, Bass, and Blue Moon, to name a few), and notably high prices (the difference between a $4 and $5 beer is that $10 gets you two beers and two tips if the draft costs $4). For the atmosphere and selection, the prices aren't really justifiable. Also, just a note if anyone from the bar reads this, it's not really a good idea to have one of the few signs of your establishment's names out front to be a piece of paper that ",2,Negative
140,Jimmy Figs,"i was there the other day with my brothers, the have pretty good food.  i don't know when but some nights the have karaoke. it's just a few blocks from the brown line l. the one bad thing is you have your back to allot of the tvs so it's not the best place to watch a game. there is a giordano's  right door so you can get a drink while you wait for your pizza.   oh ya and the wait staff is not too bad looking :-)",4,Negative
141,Jimmy Figs,"I think Jimmy Figgs is fairly new. They probably got the name from the Jimmy Figgs in the UK. Though this place does not have the English pub atmosphere. Chicago's Jimmy Figgs is a sports bar that serves food. I stopped in for lunch yesterday and had a hamburger that was okay. The highlight of this place is the cute waitresses with the low-cut school girl skirts. As a result, Jimmy Figgs is a place for dudes. I probably won't be bringing my female co-workers to this place, they don't share my appreciation of skimpy attire. Other highlights include a ton of TVs but no big screens. Lunch menu has the usual assortment of sandwiches. I did like the speed in which my food came and found the pretty waitress very attentive. Lunch cost me around 10 bucks.",3,Negative

144,Jamba Juice,"So i really like Jamba Juice, I had been raving about the Pomegranate Pick Me Up to my husband....he wanted to finally see what the fuss was about, because according to me it was 'just soooo goood'. So on a hot day downtown we decided to go in. Since I was trying to maintain my diet, I decided to get the Make it Light version, oh boy....for the next 5 hours I had the worst tummy ache ever. Not sure if it was this location, or the Make it Light that caused this, but I was not a happy camper. Also, this location was extremely slow - they had 3 workers (visible) and it took them 15 mins to take my order, and another 7 to make the 'tummy hurting make it light pomegranate pick me up' drink....",1,Negative

It's toasty warm in there, doubt the employees dig that, but coming in from the cold? It was a pleasent suprise. I got the Macha Green Tea, and it's actually excellent. I love this smoothie as much as I love the Peanut Butter Moo'd and they made it perfectly for my taste, which at some locations, is really tricky to get it just* right. Stay Classy Jamba....",5,Positive
146,Jamba Juice,"I used to love visiting Jamba Juice regularly before work. Back when they used to do daily specials like Ideal Meal Monday for $3 and Oatmeal Wednesdays for $1. However the franchise has now gotten rid of these promos and only does email blast coupons maybe once a month. While they sometimes have great offers in them to try a new featured product, I would much rather have a once a week smaller discount on the product I actually want. Plus with a different one every day of the week no matter what you like to purchase at Jamba you could find the day that has that on special. Are the smoothies good, yeah there fine. But my six dollar Ideal Meal isn't quite as appealing for breakfast when I used to be able to get it for $3 once a week and would visit other days paying full price for a smoothie",3,Positive

This Jamba Juice is within a stone's throw from my school. When I have a hankering for healthy (or 'healthy') eats, this is one of my favorite establishments. Yes, their smoothies are always delicious, but Jamba Juice recently started offering actual eats. While there are plenty of eateries in the Loop, not too many are vegetarian-friendly, healthy, AND fast. Take for example their Greens & Grains Wrap (update: no longer available). It's vegan, with red quinoa, field greens, and hummus. Included is a mango vinaigrette. I normally dislike fruity dressing, but it's actually a great match. I just tried the Greek G",5,Positive

149,Jamba Juice,"This 5-star rating goes straight to the staff at this particular Jambe Juice.  Jamba Juice is pretty much Jamba Juice no matter what location you go to.  It's the staff that really makes this place remarkable.   I'm quite certain they are the happiest, friendliest, most cheerful people in the loop - even at 7am.  I consider myself a morning person, and I don't have ish on these Jamba employees.  I swear it's the happiest place in the loop.  (Like if Disney World was in the middle of Chicago and made awesome smoothies.)",5,Positive
150,Jamba Juice,"I feel that not enough food service people get recognition when they do a fantastic job, and often only hear from customers who have had a bad experience (though this location seems to be doing just fine in the praise department).   I just wanted to say that whomever the lady at the register was at about noon today is fantastic.  Cheerful, helpful, the whole shebang.   Every visit to this location has been positive.  Keep being awesome!",5,Positive
151,Jamba Juice,"Jamba Juice is as good as it gets. For a nice healthy boost, while you are on the go, Jamba Juice will always hit the spot. They have a variety of different flavors and shakes. They also have oatmeal and other items such as protein bars, granola, muffins etc.... This particular location is right on Michigan Avenue across from Millenium Park. I was running errands and happened to stop by for a quick fix. The staff was very helpful and very friendly. Plus, they were busy and I still got my shake in about 4 or 5 minutes. They even signed me up for their rewards program and gave me free stamps for future shakes. It was pretty awesome to say the least.",5,Positive
152,Jamba Juice,"Great smoothie, love the fact you can customize it with heallthy options such as protein, energy, vitamin boost, etc. I love the high energy in this location because I usually stop in a smoothie with an energy boost after burning the midnight oil. The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 is because recently they started asking 'would you like a this or that to go with your drink'. If I wanted sometihng else I would take it... I'm just not a fan of places that try to upsell you. They should just stick to their bread and butter.",3,Positive
153,Jamba Juice,"I love real fruit smoothies...so this is the kind of place I would be all the time.  My big problem is that they just cost too much for my liking.  I would never become a regular customer on that alone.  I can't help but feel that $5 for a cup is just not worth it.   I came here a couple times cause they had a promotion for $1 oatmeal.  I tried all the flavors I believe (banana, blueberry, and apple cinnamon).  I think the best was the blueberry cause it mixed so well together.  I think the worst was the banana cause you couldn't really blend the two together.  I practically had to eat all the bananas to get to the oatmeal...whats the point in that? Of course the drinks I had tasted great, it is just the price tag that scares me off.",4,Negative
154,Jamba Juice,"I give 2 stars only because I do like Jamba Juice. Otherwise there would only be 1. However, last time I went to this location I discovered something that was not quite part of a smoothie that came up through the straw and entered into my mouth.

I came in because my friend had a buy one get one coupon and we needed to get far away from working at the Taste.. BUT OMG if all Jamba Juices were this fun I would go here morning, noon, and night. The staff is very nice and know how to have a good time. Highlight of my day: two guys - one customer and one JJ employee (maybe they knew each other? who cares) dancing to the complete Beyonce Single Ladies single. Yes, they were coordinated and knew the whole thing. I had great seats, and everyone passing by was stopping to take videos and pictures As far as the drinks - it was just... normal.",5,Positive

157,Jamba Juice,"Favorite Jamba Juice ever. There is always a large group of people waiting off to the side for their smoothies, which always scares me into thinking there's a long wait, and I may not need that smoothie after all. But I do need that smoothie, so I go anyway. Even though there's tons of people, I've never waited more than five minutes. The workers are always super friendly and talk to the customers, but it doesn't slow them down or get in the way of them doing their work. Plus, whenever I ask for the recipes to be changed, they never pause or give me weird/angry looks; they just do it how I want, no questions asked. Also, unlike other Jamba Juice locations, their blenders work. I don't get large chunks of fruit and ice, but an actual smoothie. Yum.",5,Negative

When I have to wait between trains, I rush over to this Jamba Juice and order a smoothie and my day is already better.  HOWEVER, while the smoothies are good, they're just not as good as other locations. I can't really explain why, but I've never gotten that 'MMMM!' sensation from this location.  And my last smoothie (Peach Pleasure) tasted too much like a mushy version of orange juice. The people are friendly though, and service is quick. The lines are hardly ever long -- probably because of the speedy service!",3,Positive

161,Jamba Juice,Another one of my favorite summer spots!  I've also found a whole new love for Jamba Juice ever since they introduced their low(er) calorie smoothies- just as good and half as many calories!  The strawberry nirvana is my favorite and I always get an immunity vitamin in it to keep the germs away!,4,Positive

164,Jamba Juice,I just love my Jamba Juice... the best part is the friendly and energetic service.

I tried to go with a selection low in calories and lower in sugar than the rest, and this was the winner. I loved it! The only problem was they were out of raspberries, and so they used extra strawberries and blueberries. I didn't mind, but that's just a warning to anyone who is a raspberry fanatic. Hopefully it doesn't happen very often.  My friend was shocked when he found out I had never been to Jamba Juice. Now I can see why. I waited way to long! I may be a Jamba Juice regular now.",5,Negative
169,Jamba Juice,Jamba Juice is the perfect thing when you want something filling and don't feel like your usual morning coffee.  I love their smoothies and I have trouble deciding which one to get every single time!  They have a ton of locations around the city but this is the one I usually go to and the people are so nice and they have low calorie smoothies which are really good!,4,Positive

Hell, not even some JJ employees know about them.

I'm reviewing the food today... I got a Groupon and was really excited to try a flatbread (who knew they had an oven?) and found out the Groupon didn't cover it.  So I had a choice of wrap, sandwich or salad plus a smoothie drink.  I went for the Asian Chicken wrap and wow ,was it bland.  Not bad, per say.  Just not really great.  Or even good.  I would probably make a face if I had to eat one again.  I was hoping for a new, healthy-ish food place for lunch",3,Positive

I don't like mayo so I'm generally not one to order out chicken salad, tuna salad, etc. However the chicken salad here actually tastes like, gasp!, chicken not just mayo. The all you can eat salad bar is a great deal since a build you own salad at a lot of downtown places can easily run you $10.  It's got a great selection or veggies and sides. The space itself is pretty large. We got there right around noon and had no trouble finding a seat. They did mess up my order a bit, but I think that was at least partially my fault and they corrected it right  away.",5,Negative

I had The Great Rueben, and wow, it's an accurate title.  The corned beef was perfect, the sauer kraut was German goodness reincarnate, and the size made the price worth it.  I paid $11.38 for the reuben sandwich, chips, a long slice of pickle and a fountain drink plus soft serve ice cream.  The fountain drinks are $1.99 and all you can",5,Positive

This location replaces an old, skanky Arby's and I think a crusty Sbarro Pizza location. You can tell that they're still working out the kinks as the young, nervous staff works hard to show you where to go and try to explain food options. If you've not experienced the pager system, be prepared to give your order and place a buzzer on your table, where the staff will bring you eats. Jason's offers an all you can eat salad bar for $7.59 and has a host of healthy options on the menu.  The manager's special is either half a sandwich and soup or a remix of that.  They don't use high fructose corn syrup, MSG or artificial dyes, but do use all natural ingredients and sport ",4,Positive

More flavorful than Manny's (Go ahead, old timer, smack my face for saying it!). There's an impressive salad bar, which I have yet to sample. And drinks are self-serve and re-fillable.

I had generally liked the coffee in the past and the fact they have a variety of flavors. Though, I learned early on to never order the iced coffee. They keep a jug full of stale coffee in a fridge and serve it to you in a cup of ice. It's nasty.

195,Jersey Mike's Subs,It was okay but I asked if they could put everything that is standard for a sub in a bowl for a salad and they said no.  Why?  You have bowls...

196,Jersey Mike's Subs,"I've been eating Jersey Mike's subs since 1995 when they entered Ohio.  The subs are hands down the best subs I've ever had.  If I had to rate the place solely on food they would certainly get five stars.  The Italian sub is to die.  If you are watching calories, they also have the option of making any sub into a wrap.  The toppings are always fresh and high quality.  Get it 'Mikes Way' - you can't go wrong. As to why they get three stars.....I don't like the set up of this location, or how they handle your order.  They get very busy at lunch and literally create the sandwiches like a bat out of hell.  Your sandwich gets handled by several people throughout the assembly line process and the way they flop the sandwiches around down the line reduces my hunger. I'm sure if they were any slowe",3,Negative
197,Jersey Mike's Subs,"Jersey Mike's is a solid alternative to the typical sub joints, subway, Jimmy Johns, Quiznos, etc. They cut the meat right there for you and the sandwich tastes more like an authentic deli sub than the footlong that you can get for $5 around the corner.

They did not toast the bagel, but instead threw it on the grill with eggs being cooked for someone else.  Seemed gross. After I get the bagel and am walking down the street I notice no cream cheese on the bagel. Go back to this dump and they hand me a tub out of the fridge with cream cheese.

202,Jersey Mike's Subs,"I spied this place on my way to work and today seemed like as good a day as any to give it a try. I looked online at their menu and I liked that their sandwiches come in three sizes (mini, regular, giant) and that they also offer hot subs (i.e. cheesesteaks) as well as wraps, salads and soups. I went in and stood in the line. It's kind of a chaotic setup as they just call you over to the counter when they're ready, but first they ask you if you're ordering a hot or cold sub before you're directed where to go. I opted for a 'mini' roast beef and provolone. They slice the meat, bread and cheese when you order, which was nice.

Had it been cheaper, I would have tossed it (sad face) It had a strong tuna fish flavor that had a hidden 'Cesar-like' tangy flavor. It was not good. The way the whole thing was made was strange. Only meat in the middle? After 3 bites there's no more meat. Leaving me with plain lettuce and nasty sauce. Don't cut the wrap in the middle; just let us eat it like a burrito if that's how it's actually made. Wet sandwich, not soggy there's a difference. It stayed together but I had to keep ringing/blotting it out onto napkins and the paper it came in.... It was a wrap.... It's just too much liquid.

I had the buffalo chicken wrap and while it was ok, I can't say it was anything to write home about. First off, the fact that Jersey Mike's doesn't offer spinach wraps is astonishing to me. I ended up getting the plain flour wrap which was gummy and kinda bland. The pieces fo chicken were small and the tomatoes were sparse. The wrap was big but when it's filled with mostly lettuce the bigger size ends up getting canceled out. I ended up throwing away most of the meal because eventually the chicken ran out. Who wants to eat just lettuce, tomato pieces and gummy flour?? Additionally, I ordered my wrap without cheese and onions.

I probably made a poor decision with the buffalo chicken wrap after seeing the amazing looking sandwiches. The meat was all sliced fresh and they did a pretty good job of keeping the huge lines moving. My wrap was above average, but it's nothing that I would go out of my way to get. The person I was with ordered the turkey wrap and he said it was 'the best wrap' that he has ever had. I'll be back to try one of the fresh sliced subs and I have a feeling that I'll be adding another star to my review.",4,Positive
210,Jersey Mike's Subs,I became a fan of this Mikes the day they sold every sandwich for $1 minimum donation with all the money going to a sick kids charity.  If you have ever seen the kinda lunch rush created with the words 'almost free food' in downtown Chicago... he gave away a lot of food that day. Everything is fresh as they can get it.  Show up at 10:30 when they open the doors and get the Roast Beef when it's still warm.  This place is easily better than Jimmy Johns or Subway.,4,Positive

236,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"This past July my cousin's and I were exploring downtown Chicago during a family reunion and haphazardly stumbled on this place when we noticed our stomachs starting to rumble =/ Needless to say, it was the perfect mid-afternoon snack. The intense summer heat, humidity, downtown bustle and line that formed outside the shop were no deterrence compared to the sweet and savory aromas we picked-up 3 blocks away! We ordered one 'mix' barrel and it was scrumptious! Unlike those holiday tin mixes you buy... (you know, the one's you stock up on during Christmas in case someone gives you a gift and you 'forgot' about them so you hand over a pre-wrapped/ready-tagged barrel of popcorn... haha)  Anyways, I'm getting off subject... Like I was saying, Garrett's mix is NOTHING like the tin-mixes you find",5,Positive
237,Garrett Popcorn Shops,BEST POPCORN EVER make sure try the chicago mix. perfect!!,4,Positive
238,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"Hmm, who would have thought Chicago would have such a stellar popcorn store?  On a suggestion from a friend, I tried the Chicago mix containing both cheddar and caramel crunch popcorn.  The cheddar was hot out of the barrel(?) and ended up all over my fingers.  I'm not sure I'm such a fan when it's hot.  Once it cooled down, it was much better.  The caramel corn was delicious!  They also had a great selection of Chicago inspired tins to take home as a gift.  The prices honestly weren't too bad either.  I only had a small bag, but I could see how people go through a lot of this in a very short time!",4,Positive
239,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"simply amazing.  i thought to myself, really?  how good can this popcorn really be?  i'm sure it's not as good as all the hype.  well it was all that and more!  i couldn't stop eating it and didn't care that i was making a scene while doing so!  the only bad thing was i left my bag on my tour bus.  :(",5,Negative
240,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I've waited in a line outside in the pouring rain for a Garrett's fix and I would do it again, and again, and again!  A bag of cheese, a bag of caramel, take a little from each and you've got a mix made in heaven.  Watch out for orange fluorescent fingers afterwards!",5,Negative

243,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"OK, I almost died.  I knew it would be good when there was a line out the door (a mix of tourists and your regular Chicagoans), but I didn't think that I would nearly pass out from the buttery and caramely goodness.  I got 'The Mix,' which is one part cheese corn, one part caramel corn.  Sounds gross, but tastes great. The medium size is too big for one person, and this stuff is best fresh, so don't plan for leftovers.",5,Positive
244,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"It's just popcorn. Popcorn! And yet, it is like the best thing I've ever eaten.

A few of you in there *snark alert* oughta be cutting down on this kind of stuff anyway, justsayin'. You stand in line for this?! Take pictures of it? Please. Keeps the tourists from stumbling around on the busy sidewalks during business hours, anyway.

I have to say this one is SO much better than the one on Michigan Avenue....the service is better, everyone was SUPER polite.

Popcorn was good, but I think Dale and Thomas (?) is better.",3,Positive

IT WAS WORTH IT. come here. buy lots. you won't regret it. it's worth the calories. it's worth the weight gain. it's worth the empty pocket. it's worth the greasy hands. it's worth lugging around. it's worth the long lines. it's worth the popcorn stuck between the teeth. it's worth your clothes smelling like popcorn. it's worth being yelled at by the cashier to hurry up cause there's a ton of people beh",5,Negative
250,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I have to say, even if you're not a fan of popcorn, you're gonna love Garrett's. The flavor of cheese and caramel together is genius. Along with the freshness of the popcorn, it's truly a deadly combination. I mean it. I will seriously die of a clogged artery if I lived in Chicago. I have to mention, though, it really depends on the time and location. At first, I thought it was smart of me to walk into a Garrett's that was not busy so I didn't have to wait in the horrendous line at the other Garrett's I've seen, but boy was I wrong. The first batch I got was not warm, and even a few pieces were stale. But even then, I thought the flavor was good. That's why the next day, I attempted to walk into a Garrett's that had a line right out the door. This time, the popcorn was hot and crunchy. The",4,Negative

252,Garrett Popcorn Shops,Great popcorn.  A bit on the pricey side but once they get you hooked on the carmel/cheese combo you become like a coke addict and will pay anything for your next fix.  One of the dumbest things I have ever done in my life is waiting in line for two hours at Christmas time--save yourself the hassle and just order off the Internet during the holidays.,4,Negative
253,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I'm not a fan of popcorn like I used to be, but don't let my rating fool you! The popcorn is realy good and the lines are ALWAYS long. The Chicago Mix is really good (caramel and cheese), but I prefer mines separate. :)",3,Negative

257,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"So I was totally tipped off my a co-worker that I had to stop by Garrett's before coming home. I have to thank her for the tip! Yes, it's a bit of a tourist trap and you can't really sit down and snack while you are there but the popcorn is good! Tried the Chicago Mix (cheese and caramel together). Good but not my fav. Love the traditional caramel but the highlight had to have been the caramel with cashews! Although the apple cider was also pretty tasty. Might have developed diabetes while I was there. Worth it!",4,Positive
258,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I don't get it! Believe it or not, yesterday was my very first experience with Garrett's and I was not impressed! Judging by the long lines I figured it would be totally worth it, but it wasn't at all. The line moved pretty slowly, considering the product and the fact that it is already totally prepared. At one point, a girl came out to refill the cheese popcorn and it was in a giant plastic bag that she cut open...as if it was made in some big factory (was I naive to think it would be made there?...or was it? I dunno). Anyway, I got cheese popcorn and I don't usually complain about things being too expensive, but it was! Oh well, what the market will bear, and all. It was tasty enough, but mixed in with my cheese were random pieces of caramel (no, I did not get the 'Chicago Mix'), along w",2,Negative

Unfortunately, this place closes a little early for me. I think around 8pm. I flew into Chicago for Business and we couldn't find a Garret's....we just decided to chow down to a good dinner. Fortunately there's a Garrett's inside ORD at the United terminal. I grabbed a couple of bags and the popcorn was good for a couple of days. yummy!!!",5,Positive

262,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"It's expensive and horrible for you, sort of like heroin.  And once you've had it, it's hard not to go back.  Like heroin.  Echoing the words of Becca B., the cheese/caramel mix will change the way you look at popcorn.  It certainly makes the sad drive back to Ohio a little happier though. If you don't like it *twitch*, more for me *twitch*.",5,Negative

I always find myself drooling when I'm in line waiting from the amazing aroma of the popcorn wafting in the air. It's kinda pricey, but so good you will forget about the price, lol. I love getting the chi town mix, which is the caramel popcorn mixed with the cheddar pop corn. The combination of salty and sweet is perfect. I always find myself getting a huge bag because it disappears so fast!! If you're ever in Chicago, make sure you stop by this place!",5,Positive
265,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"Sign up for the Hop on Off Tour, and get a free sample coupon for here that will give you a sample big enough for a meal!! Their cheddar and caramel mixed bag is pretty tasty, but the caramel is definitely the winner in the battle of the bag. The cheddar is good, don't get me wrong, but it does turn your fingers kind of yellow and the taste of the cheddar just fills you up way faster than the caramel which is maybe a good thing so you don't over eat this stuff ha ha My brother and I couldn't finish our two samples without getting too full or done with the flavor, but it is no wonder this place is so famous in the theater district. The second this place opened that morning, there was already a line of people waiting to pick up bags of popcorn for their offices! And the bags you can buy here",3,Positive

I was tempted to grab the jumbo but I didn't want to go overboard. Maybe I should've though because the coworkers ate it up with a mad quickness for breakfast this morning. I wanted to play it safe and so I went with the Chicago Mix: caramel crisp & cheese corn popcorn. This sweet & salty combination is a perfect balance like yin & yang. You can't go wrong with ordering this. I did sample caramel crisp with almond. Also, very very good. I'm sure the other flavors are solid as well. There's a reason why when you get on that plane to go home and you see people carrying bags from Garrett's. We're tourists and that shizzle isn't easily",4,Positive
267,Garrett Popcorn Shops,Garretts Popcorn is so freakin delicious it will make you slap someone!!!! I love it. Caramel and Cheese (the Chicago Mix) is the best!!

The staff is usually just about as cordial as the folks at the post office and whenever I walk in there you can hear ghetto-rap blasting from somewhere in the back.  Not the ideal environment for this mecca of popcorn but hey, let's face it; This stuff is like crack.  I'd buy it in a cold, dark alley if I had to!

271,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I love this place! The yummy popcorn is moderately priced and very addictive. Unfortunately you cannot get this popcorn unless you order online or downtown. The Chicago mix is gooey caramel and cheese popcorn and believe you me, you will EAT every drop. Whenever I visit St. Louis I must bring a can to my family there. If you see the long lines, jus make sure you go ahead and have your money ready, and stay off your cell phone, they won't work with you if you are on the phone! It's worth the stay in line.

272,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I saw these popcorn shops all over, and being a tourist looking to grab something to bring home to the folks, I stopped off here right before heading to the airport. Word of advice: they sell this popcorn even at the airport. Popcorn is buttery, heart-stopping and delicious. Real salt, real butter and sugar make an fantastic mix in this ultra-snack. Only that it's so fresh that it doesn't last more than a day before it goes stale. Also, the price is a bit exorbitant. But all that butter does have a price.",4,Negative

You waited on line to give you order to the unfriendly cashier. They took your order basically without even saying a word to you. As you moved down the line you received your bag of popcorn from the big bin of popcorn that had probably been sitting there under the warmer since they opened that AM.

That is why people are attracted to this place. Its best when the batches are fresh...wait too long or get there right before closing, you might get a lot of smaller kernels of popped corn since they tend to sit at the bottom of a batch, but no matter...its STILL frickin delicious.

Garrett does make the BEST caramel popcorn, I'll give him that.  Mix the cheese and the caramel together and a magical lovechild is born!

That's why, whenever I came to downtown Chicago, I'd get me a bag 'o Chicago Mix Garrett's popcorn! There is cheese corn ... and then there is Garett's! OMG. Cheese,cheese, cheese.

The flavors complement each other perfectly. It's a perfect sweet and salty combo. I wish it was a little cheaper. Six bucks is a lot for a little bag of popcorn, but it's so good that I'm willing to pay it.

The stores are all very small and have one singular purpose, to sell popcorn to the masses from morning 'til night.  Though the place smells fantastic inside and out, there is a strange icky feeling about it.  I guess it must be all the butter in the air and the cramped little retail space.

306,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I really don't like popcorn much, except when I'm at a movie, and if, on rare occasion, I pick some up from Garrett's.  I always get the cheddar/caramel mix, the smallest you can get (I think a 'medium', cuz they don't do the mix in 'small') and it's plenty for one or even two people.  It's delicious, and likely mega-fattening, you don't want to eat this stuff every day.  The only downsides, other than that, are that it is a little pricey for popcorn, and the lines, at certain times, can be ridiculous (I waited an hour in line, seriously, for a tin of this stuff around Christmas--makes a great gift, but still).  If you do buy a tin as a gift, be assured that because of the turnover, it will at least be fresh, unlike some other popcorn-tin things at Walgreen's or a grocery store.",4,Positive
307,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"The 'rents love this place when they come into town.  Me, I wouldn't visit the tourist plagued spot unless someone had a gun to my head. Regardless, that popcorn mix is damn tasty.  They really know how to coat on enough grease to make your taste buds explode!",4,Negative
308,Garrett Popcorn Shops,This is by far the best popcorn that I have ever tasted. The Chicago mix which consists of cheese and caramel popcorn makes my mouth water just thinking about it.,5,Negative
309,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"My friends that have been to Chicago insisted that I visited this place during my short stay in the windy city. After trying their recommendations of the caramel and cheddar popcorn I understood why. De-licious!!! WARNING: DO NOT EAT IT THE NEXT DAY, IT WILL GO STALE AND YOU WILL BE SAD!",4,Negative
310,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"It would be great place to stop for popcorn, except for three panhandlers who are regulars there in front of the Jackson Street shop, bothering all the Garrett customers for money to 'help a brother out' and then sneer at them and verbally insult  customers when they try to ignore them. They are out there every afternoon working the corner. If you want to maintain a professional business, Garretts on Jackson, get rid of the street rats.",1,Negative
311,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"If you visit Chicago, you must stop at Garrett. Be warned, once you start eating their famed Chicago mix (cheese/caramel), you will not stop. They pop it fresh daily and it will stay fresh for at least 3 days after your purchase, but it will probably not last that long. The portions they give are also very good for the price. A small (a little over $4) is typically large enough for 2 people to share with a little left over. I have not had to purchase anything larger than a medium (a little over $6) for a family of 4. They are centrally located all over Chicago (and in the O'Hare airport). They also allow online ordering, but it can get steep depending on the size you need. DO NOT check this on your way home if you want it to arrive at your destination. Note they won't tape or staple the ba",5,Negative
312,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I'm not impressed.   I thought it was too greasy, the cheese had no flavor, and it was waaaay overpriced. The caramel actually tasted like caramel, which is about all this place has going for it. I've tasted better combos out of Christmas tins.",2,Negative
313,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I love the popcorn - that gets five stars. It's dirt cheap, too, which was a shock to me the first time I visited. This is one of those Chicago foods that I'm glad I didn't pass up after moving here! However, this location drives me nuts. There's not enough room for the amount of customers who come in here, and then people get confused as to what they're supposed to do sometimes. If you're by the Randolph location (on the corner, right next to Oriental Theater), that location is the bee's knees. Huge, ridiculously clean, and the employees don't seem like they hate you for coming in.",4,Negative
314,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I'm not sure I can find anything wrong with Garretts. The problem starts after eating a 2 pound bag of Chicago Mix (that's caramel corn and cheese corn mixed). I find myself trying to keep my cheese stained fingers from scraping the bottom of the bag. By the time I stop to take a breadth, my stomach is reaping the consequences. I think its a little pricey for popcorn but its should be a definite stop when you are walking around downtown.",4,Negative
315,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I'm in love with and addicted to the CHEESE popcorn here!  It's like no other.  I don't even bother with the other flavors; it's always cheese for me.  Word of caution if you eat like me...You WILL be covered in orange colored cheese sauce.  It's like a not-so-pretty stain that can get on your hands and face...and if you are a pig and cram it in like me, your chin, cheeks and nose.  ;)  Eat and enjoy with care! :D Fellow Drivers:  Take public transit to get there.  No good parking options.",5,Positive
316,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"Garrett's, oh how I love thee! Whenever I am off the Jackson Redline stop, I cannot resist stopping in. Much of the time, there is a long line, but it is worth the wait. The staff is quick and friendly. Yesterday, I decided to try the caramel nut mix along with the regular large cheese corn I usually get. I find I prefer quite a bit more cheese corn in my Chicago mix, so I do it myself. It can get a little pricey, but this is one treat to try for sure. Cheesey, caramelly goodness. This is what cheese and caramel corn was meant to taste like. So satisfying! One of Chicago's, and life's little treasures. If you're visiting Chicago, it's a must have.   And then go visit the amazing architectural monument that is The Chicago Public Library main branch just a few yards away at 400 S.

318,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"Oh my, this popcorn is AMAZING! While the shop itself is not fancy (hence 4 stars. It's so tiny and looks quite like a mess behind the counter...) but I was super impressed with the flavors. Try the cheese and caramel....when they come out hot, they are SOOOO good! The line WAS long, but the ladies who work here try their best...it actually went by fast =) We got the small cheese for $3.55 + tax. I remember their Chicago mix was $4, and plain/buttery was $2.75 for small. The medium, large, and jumbo will run you much higher. Jumbo was in the $12-$13 range..however, for a snack shared between 2-3 people, a small will do just fine!",4,Positive
319,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"If Garret could make a candle, perfume, room fragrance thingamajig, I think my life would be complete. The first amazing thing about Garret's is the scent. A block away you know you are headed in the right direction. Even if you have no plan to stop, once you smell it, you have to wait in line. You HAVE to. The Chicago Mix is the best combo of salty and sweet. And the individual packets of moistened hand wipes to remove the evidence from your hands that you've consumed most of the bag before getting back to the office: Very Helpful! Buy 2 bags if going back to work... a Small to share with the vultures, the Large for when you get home!",4,Positive
320,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I am obsessed with popcorn...more specifically Garrett's Cheesecorn. Oh lordy, this stuff is intense. One cannot possibly attempt to enjoy this while watching calories or on a diet. But, it is  the best way to treat yourself every once in a while. After you've tried Garrett's, O-Ke-Doke just won't cut it. This location is small but efficient. Workers are friendly and the line really moves. I would recommend eating this stuff with a spoon or some other utensil, as your fingers will be stained orange for a long time!!!",5,Positive
321,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"The best darn popcorn ever made!  The mix is great, but don't sale yourself short.  If you can try some of the other ones like the caramel with the pecans or macadamias do it!  They are yummy.... and definitely worth the trip to the dentist.   Before I moved to Chicago I was skeptical that something like popcorn could be soooo delicious!  Well hot damn thank you maam... IT IS FANTASTIC.  I took my friends from California to get some of this magnificent popcorn and they have been bugging me ever since.  Trust and believe that you will wait in line time and time again to get your fix.  Once, we were eating and walking down Jackson and some cops stopped us and asked 'how long is the line?'  That should tell you something, right? Catch the train downtown, if you can ... so you can eat and walk",5,Positive
322,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"Yes the lines are ridiculous, yes it's crazy to mull the thought of paying $5 for a small popcorn. But that Chicago Mix with the combo of sweet caramel and salty cheddar popcorn is a damn fine combination. A friday ritual for yours truly.",4,Negative

325,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"YUMMMM!!!  man, I've never tried crack, but this is how I'd imagine crack to be like.  HIGHLY addictive, always wanting more even though you know it's not the best for your health.

326,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"I went here for the first time today. There was no line because it was 5 or so, on a Sunday, so the lack of a wait was my main catalyst to enter. It was kind of on the higher end of what I'm willing to pay for popcorn, but if you split the cost by sharing a bag with someone it would be reasonable(they give you a solid amount).  I was very hungry, so with that in mind you might want to qualify my review.. The pairing of sweet caramel crispness with greasy artificial-yellow cheesy saltiness made me feel like a chubby stoner. I could almost hear my taste buds talking to each other.    'dude....this is almost as good as cottage cheese with..uhh umm.     'dude.. take another handful.' by the time I got the bag home, nothing remained but tiny little leftover pieces.

329,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"It's just way to tempting to have this place at the corner where dozens of buses and trains go breezing by every day.  You will see many happy commuters munching away on their tasty, fresh popped corn.  You have to get the combo bag - butter, carmel and cheese all rolled into one.  How cool is that?!",4,Negative
330,Garrett Popcorn Shops,I'd love to bash this tourist wannabe but it's not that bad.  I had the pecan popcorn and I'd eat it again but I'm not in a rush to go again. It's not really that crowded here.  I don't know why it's rumored as being so crowded.,3,Negative
331,Garrett Popcorn Shops,"Service here is not that friendly.  My order was screwed up and they didn't bother apologizing.  It seemed more like a order and promptly pay ordeal.  'Move to the side' was quickly uttered as I finished ordering.  Consistent in quality, but definitely odd in terms of a reputable company.",3,Negative
332,George's Cocktail Lounge,"George's is one best dive bars around. The bartenders are extremely friendly, and if you're by yourself waiting for someone, they're glad to strike up a conversation if they're not busy. The price of drinks is very cheap, and its a very comforting atmosphere. I've never seen the place packed, or anyone having an issue inside. It's truly a diamond in the rough for its location. Although, frequently on weekends there is a famous panhandler that will hangout outside. He's quite a feisty 'little' guy, but if you live in Chicago, you've seen worse. Great place, great drinks, great prices, great fun.",4,Positive
333,George's Cocktail Lounge,"Total dive bar and hole in the wall type of joint. I love it. Great jukebox, great parking late night, and you can always get something to go late night. Atmosphere isn't great at all....But that's not the purpose of this place.",4,Positive

335,Ghostbar,"Ghostbar is an overpriced and 'wannabe' swanky joint.  I went for a large social event where everyone was classy and spending big bucks, but we somehow managed to receive horrible service.  Our bartender, Dion (yes, I called him out) was super rude and clearly hadn't had any customer service training.  It was bad enough that the drinks were overpriced and very weak, but then to have Dion go off on me and my friends was the most uncouth thing I have ever experienced. This particular individual about whom Dion was complaining was charged $18 for a Remy and cranberry juice, which is ridiculous. I can only assume that is the reason the individual tipped lightly.  But, that was none of my business because my friends and I had been leaving hefty tips all evening. When I asked Dion for another dr",1,Negative

SO, I have to say that I thought they were pretty good.  The Coconut was really nice and moist and the frosting was scrumptious, I could have eaten it by the spoonful!  The Vanilla bean cupcake was not as dense as the coconut, but it was still as good because it was nice and light had a really nice flavor.  The frosting wasn't my favorite, it was ok, but after a while it was almost a little too much.   Were they as good as other cupcake trucks I've tried?  No, but they were really good, good enough for me to want to try that carrot cake, and the coconut again. The price is what is a bit of a turnoff, I guess I am a b",3,Positive
338,GiGi's Bake Shop,"So, I will be honest. I've seen this lilac-colored truck outside my office several times over the past few weeks . . . and every time I've felt the urge to try it, I've gone on Yelp, realized it's nowhere to be found, and changed my mind. I guess I figured that, if Gigi's was really legit and good, it would be on here already. Today, though, I absolutely needed something sweet and I didn't care that this lone truck had no previous Yelp reviews. I wanted cupcakes and I couldn't deny the fact that there were plenty to be had just a few steps from my building. I bought the pumpkin latte, the toasted coconut, and the carrot for $3.50 a pop which is a considerable amount of money just for dessert, but I figured it would be worth it if I shared with my coworkers. The cupcakes come in really nice",4,Positive
339,Gina's Cuisine,"Great little grease factory in the south loop, just  a block and half away from the Harold Washington branch of the Chicago Public Library. Actually a decent value, I've paid more for a burger and fries in the suburbs. Fantastic mozzarella sticks too. The inside is small, maybe 9-10 tables and a 3-4 person bar. In the summer they set up a few outdoor tables. If you come during normal lunch times be prepared to get creative in your eating location.",5,Positive

It was huge, served open face, and totally delicious. I had to really work at holding it together, but other than that I was happy. My lunch companions seemed happy with their food as well. No one was raving, but it was good. Not on top of the try again list, but perfectly acceptable.",3,Positive
341,Gina's Cuisine,"Once in awhile, I take my 7star schanookie to lunch, and let me tell you, baby, I spare EVERY expense in these economic times! There's something about these greasy little joints. If you get them, you get them -  a siren call no urban sailor can resist. If you don't, no amount of cajoling will get you thru the door. Thankfully - as unashamed as an adult who has not lost their taste for Tang (me) - that is the adoration I unabashedly hold for these boites. Serendipitously, my companion was a good get to go to Gina's on this incredibly rainy day. Plus, it was across the street from where we were. The food.

344,Gino's East Sports Bar,"I get the sense this Gino's East is more of a tourist trap than a neighborhood eatery.  The pizza is good but vastly overpriced.   We ordered the speciality deep dish with the venison.  The 9 inch pizza could not have contained more than 7 or 8 small crumbles of venison.  When you pay $25 for a 9 inch pizza, you expect it to be loaded with ingredients.  Not here. Before this, we dined in and had one of the gourmet thin crust pizzas with a calimari/zucchini appetizer.  Service was okay, but once again, we did not find much value in what we ordered.  In fact, the bottom of the calimari/zucchini was stuffed with paper to make it look much more impressive than it really was.  Not cool.  Again, the pizza was good, but probably 25% overpriced. This iteration of Gino's East is okay if you want so",2,Positive

They have 12 chicago local beers on tap and I was able to start with a beer flight, very cool, and I got to pick any 3 I wanted to try.   There are definately some inetersting menu additions like a chopped brisket sandwich, which I will have to go back to try since I opted for the arugula avocado salad and the new Jalapeno Blue Deep Dish, the salad was fresh and light and",5,Positive

The atmosphere was really nice and our waitress was really friendly. We appreciated the variety of craft beers available.

Strike 2 - I clearly ordered a 12 inch thin crust pizza but received and was charged for a large. Strike 3 - My drink sat empty at times... I was feeling under the weather that day so I didn't get to tap into their beer selection which looked pretty good. The pizza itself was pretty good. The price points are pretty high here.

I know that sounds like a lofty statement, but the patty is SO delicious (made in-house) on a fresh brioche roll. My boyfriend opted for the jalapeño blue cheese deep dish - a great twist on chicago's classic deep dish. -DRINKS - My boyfriend was impressed by their extensive beer list and I was very pleased by the wine selection. -DESIGN - I love the detail they put into the space; Gorgeous interior and cool ambience.

The Group On limited us to one beer a piece and a medium sized pizza.  I was particularly curious to try the Flossmoor Station brew that was listed on the Group On HOWEVER - this Gino's East didn't carry it!  False marketing.  I will have to alert Group On.  And oddly enough, this is the third place in the city that has a Flossmoor Station beer listed on their menu and hasn't been able to produce it for me in a glass or any other form.  Once I was told it was 'lost.'

I thought the prosciutto was over salted and when my server asked how it was, I told him it was salty and he just said 'oh' without offering to remake it or give me another dish. I was really disappointed in that. I've also had the salmon dish which also wasn't great. Overall, the food is not worth the price tag.",2,Negative

I had the scallops, I can't say that they melted in my mouth; they were indeed enormous; though, I've had better - however, these were not bad, they just weren't what I was expecting.  I also had a severe case of wanting what my son and his girlfriend were having, to that may have colored my opinion somewhat!   The litmus test for us at any Italian restaurant though, is their Tiramisu.

I had a the shrimp bucatini and the shrimp weren't deveined! C'mon now - that's just bush league! Maybe the shrimp poop detracted the flavor from the sauce, because I found the dish bland. Hubby had the mushroom ravioli, which he said he enjoyed Dessert was very good - mascarpone tart and the tiramisu. If you're into  cordials & wines, you can't go wrong with the housemade limoncello or the Bigaro Moscatto. Love the location, as well as the ambiance.

361,Gioco,This place left a lot to be desired.  The service was subpar- the hostess paid more attention to us than our server.  I find the food to be generally overpriced for what you get and the selection lacking enthusiasm.  I hate to reveal that my Garganelli con Prosciutto tasted a slight step above a lean cuisine and my husband's Tagliatelle Toscano was utterly disappointing.  We will not be returning here.,2,Negative
362,Gioco,"Went here with my wife and her parents.  I've heard and read mixed reviews about Gioco but was very happy to have some of the best italian food I've had in Chicago, even though I previously lived in Little Italy.  In my opinion this is a step above Rosebud and Tuscany and a few steps above Jay's on Taylor.  I had bison ragu, my wife had seafood risotto but most memorable was my mother-in-law's mushroom pizza.  All were good and I was very surprised by my ragu -- very rich and creamy taste.  The pizza was great, looking forward to getting one of these as takeout for a Millennium Park for a concert.",4,Positive

This irritated me to no end since I got to hear Mr. Neighbor slurp his pasta. And our waiter - yuck! Didn't explain the antipasti selections even though we asked. I was somewhat sad that they offered no green salad but we went on to order anyway. After we ordered, we overheard another waiter voluntarily tell his guests that a Cesar salad is always available even though it's not on the menu.

Well, that all changed with each course that came out of this quaint Italian restaurant. From the Italian bread with the olive oil and Parmesan cheese, to our appetizers of carpacchio and mussels, we were off to a good start.  Our martinis were perfectly poured which made the decision to order a bottle of wine just that much harder. We finally settled on an Amarone (one of my favs). As for entrees we did what we usually do at an Italian restaurant- each ordering one and then splitting a pasta course as a side dish.  The side dish we chose, the",4,Positive
367,Gioco,"I'd give this place 5 stars but some of their tables are insanely close together and makes things a little uncomfortable sometimes, so 4 stars it is. But Gioco is a great place. If you've walked by Gioco at night, then you know when you look inside that everyone's having a great time. I get a little jealous myself walking by when I have no one to go there with. I feel your pain. But once you're inside, it's awesome. Everybody loves Italian food and you won't find any surprises on the menu, but everything is prepared very well. I've always been a sucker for caprese salads, but the arugula and pear salad is where it's at. On the pasta side, you can never go wrong with the gnocchi. And for an entree, I'm always going with the veal. They pound that veal down and serve it up with prosciutto and",4,Positive

369,Gioco,"Gioco is the kind of Italian place that I think was common in Chicago 40 years ago - big servings of stick-to-your-ribs mains, with a little bit of a creative spin on some of the starters and desserts.  There's nothing wrong with that, but for me that style is hard to rate higher than 'A-OK.' We started with a heart-of-palm salad, which was actually really a good salad. But we ordered it split, and even the split portions were honestly too big for one person.  There is such a thing as too much of a good thing. As mains we got the lamb and the pork.  Both were nice, although the portions were just enormous.  I hadn't eaten lunch that day, which is a good thing.  Finally, despite the quantity of food we'd already had, we opted to try dessert.  I had the 'rasberry soup,' and my dining compani",3,Positive

371,Gioco,"You really can't ask for anything more.  Especially since it's priced right.  Northern Italian food and outstanding service.  The chef and the staff are true heroes.  Salads taste like none other and the entrees were perfectly planned out, not overpowering like some N-Italian spots but ultra tasty.  Limited space to sit outside so inform them when you make your reservation.  Perfect for any occasion.",5,Positive
372,Gioco,"I was here for dinner last week and had a great experience.  I'm still kicking myself for not going with pizza or steak (highly recommended by Adri M.) but whatever -- everything we had was pretty amazing.   A friend and I shared the mussles, which were delicious.  Made with a very simple sauce is always my favorite way to eat mussles and this was just that -- white wine, garlic and tomato. My friend had the lamb shank special and LOVED it and I had the white fish (fava beans, tomato, garlic, onion, pancetta, saffron vinaigrette).   I only wish that they had a bottle of wine for less than $50 on the menu!  It's awesome that they offer such quality Italian wine, but it's nice to have at least a few bottles in the $20-30 range.   Overall, a very nice atmosphere with great service and food.  ",4,Positive
373,Gioco,"Things I love about Gioco: -Their olive oil. I kid you not - boyfriend and I enjoy the bread/olive oil entirely too much for that to be complementary. -Kung-Fu Girl Riesling. no, not just because of the name - or the fact that it's riesling. it's fruity without being too sweet. -Their pasta dishes. Tortelloni is always a great choice - that sage sauce makes me want to lick the dish after I finish. Their gnocchi and pappardelle are also pretty amazing. -Their specials - which is why i can't speak to their regular menu too well. specials...are always amazing though. -Brunch scones! Citrus almond with mascarpone cream, anyone? Beef carpaccio is decent, but nothing to write home about. Ditto with the eggs benedict. Last, street parking can be a pain in the ass - i recommend leaving 20 minutes ",4,Negative

I've tried the Gnocchi (carb loading evening), the Salmon (my steady eddy) with fresh vegetables and those with me rave on an on about their steak, talapia and pastas. All in all, there's nothing we have every ordered that's been a miss.  However, there's one thing everyone has to order whenever I go and it's the asparagus risotto (careful it's got white wine and can be addictive)!

There were many interesting adventures on the menu otherwise - some rabbit, some crazy seafood, things like that. I'd go again.",4,Negative
377,Gioco,Let me start by saying the stacked wine separating the two dining areas are really unique and even though we set at a small table it was still very nice. I enjoyed the quaint atmosphere. I felt like I was sitting in a little bistro it was really nice. The menu is very well rounded we partook on several different items. (is partook a word?) Oh well!!!     Mussels were so good!!!! Soup Du jour was a palm leave whipped lobster bisque it was phenomenal. Ravioli stuffed with Mushrooms were very good as well. The pasta tasted as if it was home made and the mushrooms so so fresh.

Apparently Al Capone and his buddies used to play poker or gamble back here and there are still drawings of him and others on the walls.  The walls are all exposed brick, the room is pretty dark, and it just set the perfect backdrop for our party.  The only downfall was that it did get a little warm back there with all the guests, but we managed.

The menu was amazing; many options spoke to me but I managed to restrain myself and order just one entree...After a glass of wine and sharing the Caprese appetizer (which had amazing olive oil on it) I ate as much of the Prosciutto pizza I ordered as possible. Never one to pass up dessert if I have room, I sampled the chocolate cake on Marcello's recommendation for something good to share. It was warm and delicious. Everything was very good and reminded me of being in a restaurant on Bologna! The place is seriously charming! And the South Loop locale is great; very close to the Brown Line.",5,Positive
381,Gioco,"Wow. That is all I can say. My friends from out-of-town and I spent an evening dining at Gioco and we were all blown away. We started out with fried calamari and prosciutto appetizers and they were amazing. The sauces with the fried calamari were sensational. Around the horn, my date had pasta (I don't recall which one, but I know it was the one that was made with speck) and it was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. I had the pork tenderloin scallopini and it was also great-- fantastic potato salad-esque side dish. The dish of the night was ordered by my friend's fiancee-- she had the veal entree and after trying one bite I was kicking myself for not ordering that as well. Damn it.

The food was nice, rich.  I liked the ambiance better than the food, actually.  But, they do have some creative dishes and I would go again.  Our waiter was a little aloof.  Maybe he was trying to give us our space, but we had to flag him down to order our meal after we were done with our appetizer.",4,Positive
383,Gioco,"It's hard for me to make up my mind about Gioco.  I really want to love it, but I can only like it.  And it seems I like it a little less with each visit.  I've been here four times over several years, and it just seems that it isn't as good as it used to be.   Why do I want to love Gioco?  Because it's semi-local and because it just has a sort of cool vibe.  I like the bricks.  I like the bar.  And I like the open kitchen, as long as the place is somewhat busy.  If it's not busy, it will seem like the kitchen staff is laser beaming you. The problem with Gioco for me is that there's not much on the menu I can eat due to my ever present picky palate.  I've gone with the steak on most occasions.  Once I had the pasta with ragu meat sauce.   The steak is good, but I think it was best the firs",3,Positive

It is in a bustling area of the South Loop that many moons ago, was part of the whole speakeasies and ill repute known to mankind, but that is the gift of the area and to think that businesses are starting to bustle is really a good thing. Also other prohibition-era establishments including Al Capone's headquarters was once housed here. I was invited by my dear friend Jeanette for dinner (who happened to of purchased dinner tickets on SWOOP, its like Groupon).

I had the papardelle pasta with roasted boar (thanks Kristin!) which was superb! The meat was soft and fresh. The tiramisu was just average though- its the heavy kind, not the soft fluffy kind. Overall, this place is one to return to. What's stopping me for giving it 5 stars? The not-so-friendly hostess who DID NOT GREET ME at the door.

Some people stated that they felt their service was lackluster due to their groupon.  However, before I even presented my groupon today, we waited for 10 minutes to be greeted by our server in a completely empty restaurant.  This would annoy me under any circumstance but is always infuriating when I am dining with my toddler, as there is a time limit ",3,Negative
397,Gioco,"Great Italian steak joint. The place is narrow but dinning rooms go far back so it looks tight when you walk in but there's room. Atmosphere for dinner is cozy and dark. I would recommend asking for a table away from exposed kitchen because it tends to get noisy and a bit warm from the grill but if you re like me and enjoy watching how it all works then its no problem. They have the best Pappardelle al Ragu Di Cinghiale, which is wide ribbon pasta with a wild boar sauce and pine nuts. Don't let the word boar scare you, this dish is great.

Other dishes at the table were the skirt steak and clam linguini, which were all presented very well. Most important, the dishes were finished so the portions were just right and delicious.

In a blind taste test, I don't know that I could pick them out from frozen. I've never had a stellar meal at any of the KDKs, though they've all been reliably expensive and over-hyped.

421,Gioco,"We live a few blocks from Gioco--easy walking distance-- so end up eating here more often than we would if we lived driving distance.  In fact, I'm not sure how often we'd eat here if it were less convenient.   The decor is typical  trendy--exposed brick walls, high ceilings with all the mechanicals exposed, very loud background noise.  You also run the risk of being seating along the railing, which means that another party is either directly above or below you.  I've wondered why they don't stagger those tables, like theater seats.  Probably they can cram more in this way.  You can also get stuck next to the open kitchen, which is either interesting or annoying depending on your take. Service:  Spotty.  We've had attentive, friendly waitstaff like the girl we had last night.  We've also h",3,Negative
422,Gioco,"Tsk tsk. Sad. A prime South Loop location, but a boring, and overpriced restaurant. This chain of places owned and created by the same person, all kind of look the same - like the Cheesecake Factory trying to be romantic and intimate. While I enjoyed my food at Marche, this is unfortunately not the case at Gioco. I had the Pesce Bianco. A whitefish on a bed of brocollini with inedible leaves, partially cooked fava beans, and little to no flavor. After spitting some leaves out, I ate more of my whitefish, which wasn't terrible, though the poor accompaniments were not helpful. The description of the dish sounds hopeful, but the taste is failure. I was not a fan of Gioco.",2,Negative

Scallops are so delicious, so is the veggie tortelloni (can't remember the full name). Portions are quite small - so appetizers are highly recommended to fill your belly. Tiramisu ranks below the average - I wasn't impressed, but I'm hard to please when it comes to that one. Wine selection is great. Perfect for fun, group dinners. Only four stars because of the tiramisu, and the decor - I'm more of a traditional, Sicilian, family kind trattorias when it comes to Italian.",4,Positive
426,Gioco,"This is some of the most rustic, authentic tasting Italian food I've had. The sauces truly taste like they are old-school recipes that have been simmering all day, awaiting your arrival for dinner. I like the portion sizes are appropriate. You aren't drowning in a bowl of heavy pasta, you are served the right amount of an intensely flavorful, well-done meal. The noodles are definitely hand-made and cooked to a perfect al dente. While they are known for their pizzas, I have yet to enjoy one. That is, however, the smell that hits you the moment you walk into the door. The wines-by-the-glass selection is small, but packs a punch. Try the Montepulciano for a surprise and delight. Oh, and save room for dessert.

Service is good on the 2 occasions I have been. Appetizers were great and we did some small plates of olives, cheeses, veggies--which were fantastic. Minuses:  A bit overkill on the grease/fat content in the sauces. Some of the recipes try to hard by adding in a lot of salt, fat, sugar type ingredients/flavors.  Still a nice place. I probably won't go back for a long while because there is so much competition in Chicago for Italian food at a good price, which tastes great. Gioco is a bit pricey and good, but not great.

For the main course I had the New York Strip in a red wine sauce. It came with diced potatoes mixed with onions and garlic on the side. My husband had the Prime Ribeye that came with mashed potatoes. We were both very unimpressed. My potatoes were hard and cold. For a second I though I was eating a Stouffer's frozen dinner.

I ordered the only chicken item on the menu and found it bland and just ok.  The service was decent.  I think since my expectations were so high and finding such a limited choices from the menu being a non-seafood person I wouldn't find myself going back there, especially for the price.  Not worth it to me.",3,Negative
440,Gioco,"Fantastic food, fantastic wine list, cheese served at perfect temp, and stellar service.  We liked it so much we've been there 3 times in 2 weeks!  Also, other Italian restaurants in Chicago take note, this is how you serve olive oil, fresh and not rancid.  I can't count how many Italian restaurants I've been to in the last year that have had off olive oil.",5,Positive
441,Gioco,Good place and great food.  Last time I went there I actually got a $50 gift card to use over at Opera (one of their 'sister' restaurants).  Both places are great.  At Gioco they have FANTASTIC Calimari along with some nice desserts as well.  My only complaint is that some of the tables are too small but otherwise very highly recommended.,4,Positive

I love their antipasti selection.  They also have a couple excellent salads on the menu.  My favorite entree is the ricotta and spinach tortilini because it is simple and perfect.  The pasta is fresh, and I can taste the difference.  Other favorites include the gnochi with ox tail, and the risottos of the day are very good. Due to the location (by Soldier field), sometimes the restaurant is filled with a mix of people in Bears jerseys and couples on dates.  I do love the atmosphere.  The bar is very pretty, and I love the exposed brick walls. They also have a couple of rooms in the back for events. Definitely call ahead for a reservation, and call to confirm.  They have a ditsy hostess who lost my reser",5,Positive
444,Gioco,"Yet another Jerry Kleiner restaurant that fails to impress me; I find Gioco to be overpriced and the food simply average. There are no real standouts on the menu - you'll find the usual Italian offerings: carpaccio, calamari, pasta in a meat ragu sauce, and pizza. I did really like the ravioli di funghi, although Follia, which has since closed, made far better pasta (but suffered from a horrible location). I can actually deal with average Italian food, but what gets me about Gioco are the prices. Simply put, an $11 caprese salad better knock my socks off. We easily spent over $150 on dinner for two and it just wasn't worth it. The outside dining sounds nice, but it can actually pretty loud on Wabash, especially with the El thundering overhead.

I then orderd the parma proscuitto thinking it would be delicious, thin, light and salty like they do it in Parma Italy.  Essentially what came out was thin-deli cut ham, did not even taste like proscuitto, very disappointed.  We both took one small bite and did not even finsih it.

For the main dishes, I ordered the Spaghetti alla Chitarra, while he had the Veal.  The spaghetti was tasty, particularly the meat. Overall, it was a nice place, and service was very good.

I didn't study the menu too closely (I knew what I wanted), but it looks pretty much like it used to. We started with the antipasto tasting thingy...and it really was amazing. It was an excellent combo of all the things I would have ordered normally, including my new favorite thing in the world - burrata. The bread was also really great.

However, they do have an open area where you can see the chefs working, which is nice. I had their artichoke hearts and fennel salad which is really good - light, with a very generous portion of thinly-sliced (think razor!) mushrooms.  I am usually not a fan of cream-based pasta, however, I think in this case you really, truly, must go for the proscuitto, mushroom, green peas pasta (sorry the name escapes me.

First off the place is pretty cool inside. Kind of a two tiered layout with a hip vintage feel to it. Bottles of wine all over the room and a neat open kitchen that makes you feel like part of the action but also makes sitting too close to the kitchen a little warmer than I find comfortable.

We started with a wine recommendation from our server which was excellent.  Next we choose the daily anipasta offering with was veal meatballs, bruschetta and fried tortellini.  While the tortellini was okay, the meatballs were very tasty and the bruschetta had a great mix of garlic and tomatoes.  Even the complimentary bread had an almost peppery & smokey flavor to it that made it better than the normal Italian restaurant bread offering.  For entrees, I choose the tortelloni and my partne",5,Positive

We had a prix fixe menu, so the entree I had is not on the menu, but I had the pork tenderloin and it was fantastic. It was a little bit smoky, and somehow extra porky.... so, maybe try the pork chop if you go. The brussel sprouts were delicious. The Tortelloni Di Spinaci E Ricotta, which was on the menu, was amazing. Creamy, spinachy, tender. Delicious.

A little too much cheese for my taste but eh, how often will I really eat authentic Chicago deep dish pizza? There was a large group of us (14) and we were accommodated well and in good time. After we all finished we walked [very] leisurely back to the hotel and passed out in our own individual food comas.

While it is undeniable that we love pizza, something about having to wait thirty to forty minutes for a pizza that is basically a lasagna with a crust seemed less than appealing to me. On our lunch visit, we ordered a twelve inch diameter medium special, which includes sausage and mushrooms with green peppers and onions, for our group of three and none of us could stomach the amount of cheese loaded into each bite of the pizza.

Anyway, the pizza actually did have really good quality ingredients but there was SO much cheese. I love deep dish pizza but omg I'm talking several inches of cheese.

It does have it's kitschy overtones of Italy and patience is needed for the pizza to be made but it's worth the wait.  The crust was light and buttery and the thick pizza topped with sauce and gooey cheese, it makes you want more but you can only eat up to 3 slices.   Definitely to add on your to do list in chicago.  Deep dish pizza at its finest.",5,Positive

This is the place you go if you love cheese on your pizza.  Get a deep dish, and you'll get enough cheese to clog your arteries for weeks.  (This is a good thing.) But if you love this style of deep dish, I think Edwardo's does it better.  The ingredients there are better.  Giordano's just tastes a little... bland.  And personally, I'd go for Lou Malnati's or Pizzeria Due before selecting Giordano's. But Giordano's has locations all over the city, particularly in the Loop area, so it does get points for convenience.  Because this location is so near Grant Park, I've ordered takeout and walked a pie over for the Outdoor Movie Festival.

After waiting 40 minutes for my freshly baked pizza/pie, I cut into this thing of beauty. Cheese and toppings oozed out (it reminded me of a chocolate lava dessert with the warm center pouring out). I couldn't wait a minute longer, I tried to pick up a piece and barely made it to my mouth...MMM, this stuff was good, real good. I loved the texture of this pizza.

I also thought the cheese inside wasn't melted enough.. You know wasn't the gooey cheesy goodness i was expecting... Was more like eating a block of cold cheese stuffed inside a crust... We boxed our left-overs and microwaved it the next day and i thought it tasted better if not very good.. maybe because the cheese inside was melted enough...

Ordered the Veggie deep dish to go cause the place was packed. It says it's enough for 1 - 2 persons, I'd say you could even split it with 3 people. The pie was a lot thicker than I expected.

But the pizza itself was overwhelming, our mushrooms and olives were smothered by the cheese, and in general it felt like way too much. I realize that deep dish isn't meant to be a 'light meal,' but I feel like Lou Malnati's finds the perfect ratio of ingredients to cheese to crust for a deep dish pizza.",3,Positive

628,Giordano's,"Ordered their stuffed pizza special. I ordered the small one, the one for one or two... damn more like a family it's so thick, but that's not a complaint. My complaint is that if you are gonna stuff veggies in two and a half inches of cheese, don't drive them home raw, they should have been sautéed at the very least to give them some browning and taste. The raw veggies ruined the pizza for me. Using pie crust as pizza dough is interesting and adds a whole different spectrum to the taste. I also ordered cheesecake as desert - not knowing how huge this pizza pie would be - and it was yet another one of those run of the mill cheesecakes that can be found at your local Costco. All in all an average experience.",3,Negative

It was the strangest thing, I felt a little sick immediately afterward (from consuming dough and cheese very quickly topped by two beers), but after that, it was like I had just gotten all of my eating done, and could focus on other things.  I didn't feel bloated or gross, just un-hungry.  It was a little amazing.  If I lived in Chicago, I could just eat here once a day and be set--it would be totally efficient.

I freaking love deep dish.  I love the pie like crust with the meaty sauce and thick cheese.  This place is so damn good. I have had some of the top reviewed places in NYC and there is no comparison to Giordano's.  I have had Pizzeria Uno and while I really enjoyed it I still prefer Giordano's.

Pizza coming out: 'Ooh this looks tasty. It's about 1 inch in thickness. Massive pizza.' I was severly underwhelmed at Lou Malnati's so this looked promising.

However, the girl that helped me at the take out counter was NOT friendly at all. no hint of a smile, and when I asked for plates and utensils, did not seem pleased at my request. The pizza itself was not impressive. the crust at the bottom was a little soggy. I didnt taste much sauce. I mostly tasted was the chewiness of the cheese. There was supposed to be sausag",2,Negative
722,Giordano's,"I love pizza but I like them deep dish style. So when I got to Chicago, deep dish pizza was on top of the priority list. Getting lost on the street of Chicago, my friend Kathy and I came upon groups of hungry people waiting to get seated outside Giordano's. We immediately decided that this is the place to try! The hostess adviced us that we should order after 45 mins of waiting. Hungrily, after 45 mins, my friend and I ordered the Antipasto Salad and a smallest size pizza, 10 inches stuffed spinach pizza. After that, we waited another half an hour, which meant we waited an hour and half for pizza. Starving as I walked to the table, I thought to myself, this better be good! The Antipasto Salad came with imported ham, Genoa salami, Provolone cheese, black olives, red onion, pepperocini peppe",3,Positive

I have been numerous times and there always seems to be a 35 minuet wait, which is OK considering the reward is top notch deep dish pizza. If you are presented with a wait and are going to order a deep dish pizza, put the order in while you wait and if the timing works out you can get your pizza not to long after getting your table, which beats waiting for 35 min to be seated and then waiting another 30 min for the pizza to bake. The pizza is layer upon layer of pizza goodness and is very filling.

I do not care for their pizza, and the menu offers little else that's even remotely appetizing. This location is set up kind of cramped - we couldn't stop bumping elbows wherever we sat. Despite the close quarters, for whatever reason, every server we've had has somehow missed 2-3 people at a big table. Very odd. The thing that killed the outings was when we showed up with a reservation twice in a row, and they couldn't sit us all together - some were in booths, others were at a table in a different room...it was really awkward and irritating.

I guess it comes down to this, I notice great pizza is somehing I can't put down, and this pizza didn't really pass that test. BUT this is a chain and I think it was great for the area.

The calamari and antipasto appetizers were decent. Nothing phenomenal but they were served promptly, which helped tide us over while waiting the typical 45 minutes for the pizza to come out. We got their 'special' (sausage, mushrooms, onions, green peppers) but I felt like it was essentially a big, thick cheese pizza with a few good chunks of sausage.  But mostly you just get a big mouthful of cheese.  I agree with other reviews, that the crust is rather raw and doughy-tasting, which I really noticed and brought the pizza down a notch.

Sorry Chicago, but NYC definitely kick butt in regards to the pizza department. What we ordered: 2 deep dish pizza. One with ham and pineapple and the other with mushroom and pepperoni. The pizza was way too doughy and there wasn't enough sauce. The cheese tasted pretty good but that was about it.   The line for this place was super long so we ordered take out but ended up sitting near the bar.

I gathered my recommendations, checked out the local Yelp Reviews, and asked a friend who lives in Chicago what the best deep dish spot is... The most popular Deep Dish pizzas can be found at either at Gino's East or Pizza Uno (according to recommendations)... At the last minute, our friend who lives in Chi-Town demanded that we go to Giordano's because they are the underdog of deep dish and truly have the best pie. We took his advice and headed to giordanos... Now, I can't compare it to the other two places, but i do know that i had one amazing, ooey, gooey, cheesy, sausage deep dish!",4,Positive
783,Giordano's,"I was generally not impressed by Giordano's. I was in town shooting a short film for a few weeks and the producer insisted on ordering Giordano's because he KNEW it was the best pizza in Chicago, and clearly we all know that producers generally know EVERYTHING. That being said, the pizza itself was somewhat lackluster in appearance, taste and texture. The crust was quite lacking in crispness and flavor, sort of a bland wheat crust that merely held everything together. It had a greasy taste to it as well, like cardboard with canola oil slathered on it. The sauce was applied in a very thin layer, and was barely present in the overall taste of the pie and the fats in the cheese really overpowered any acidity in the tomato sauce. So it tended to not cut through overall and would certainly be o",2,Positive

So be it. I'm not a fan of the idea of deep dish. Too much cheese, too much bread for my taste. How is everyone not huge from enjoying this stuff? There wasn't that long of a wait for a table for our large group, plus. We ordered a fried appetizer sampler platter, a large thin crust style pizza and a deep dish for one of the ladies.

I had never been to this location before and anticipated it to be less crowded than the original or any other Chicago location, but I was wrong!  There was a constant line and groups waiting outside on Friday night.  And for good reason!

Even the crust is more like pie crust in texture and flavor then anything remotely like any other pizza you've had. It so happens that the crust is absolutely the best part of Giordano's pie.

810,Giordano's,I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza but I consider Giordano's to be the best. Their filling is mozzarella stringy-gooey without being oily and the crust is more like a real pie crust (flakey and doughey) unlike the greasy spongy focaccia-like crust typical of other deep dish pizzas. This Chicago chain can get super crowded so it might be better to order in (which is what we did after balking at the wait at another Giordano's location).,4,Positive

This isn't a place to go to for the atmosphere, so don't be disappointed. What is disappointing is how cold this place is!

Both my husband and I got sick after eating the pizza, but that might just be our inability to digest cardboard, cheese, and grease. Perhaps due to the food, or perhaps due to the 45+ minute wait for service (we had to get on a list for a table, and then waited again at the table), everyone in this place looked utterly miserable.  I can't even count the dirty looks I personally got from fellow diners, which is unusual to say the least.  This happen to anyone else?

After giving  Giordano's a few tries they have done the impossible by disappointing me. For all the hype this place gets, the pizza did not meet expectations. The tomato sauce on the deep dish pizza was overwhelming and didn't taste fresh. I had to drink a lot of water after my first slice because the bread was so thick and dry. When you bite into it feels like you are just biting through layers. The tomato sauce, cheese, and bread doesn't feel integrated. Their thin crust however was solid. But its hard to mess up a thin crust pie. The wait staff are very nice. Overall the pizzeria is average. I don't sit at home and drool thinking about this place. I would only come back if friends invited me",3,Negative

It's hard to keep your eyes open while eating this...mmm",5,Positive
846,Giordano's,"Best known food about Chicago is their deep dish Pizza. Oh, did I mention this was the best pizza I have ever tasted? I must admit I am a big sucker for Cheese but this pizza was cheese heaven. when you slice into the pizza and pick it up the strings of cheese are endless and you must saw it off into order to finally claim it on your dish. I had pepperoni with jalapeno and it was all very wonderful! It's definitely a good experience with a long 2 hour wait. But this pizza was literally deep in cheese.",4,Positive

While I was waiting I had some local beers on tap and they were excellent.  My bartender Marcee was the best.  She kept me company and my glass full the entire time i was there...which ended up being around 3 hours.

861,Giordano's,My first time to Chicago and I had to try some deep dish pizza. This place seemed like a good choice based on reviews. I love pizza. I waited the 30 mins like he said. Got a sausage stuffed pizza. It looked good and when I took that first bite.....that's it? There wasn't much flavor to it. I couldn't taste the sausage. The worst part for me was the crust. It was flaky for some reason. I was truly disappointed. They were busy and there are many good reviews so I don't know why I don't feel the same way. Not at all impressed. The next day I tried the Art of the Pizza and that's how I expected it to taste!! I would pass here and try somewhere else. But the service was friendly and prompt.,2,Positive

Part of the reason for this is the waitress informed us the cook time for deep dish (DD) would be 35-45 minutes and since our son had never had DD before, he opted to try a peperoni and cheese DD. However, that pretty much puts anyone getting DD at 60-90 minutes minimum, so that explains the long waits and low table turnovers. It also encourages people to order the appetizers which we resisted to keep the bill down. We opted for a thin crust pizza and promptly scarfed it down as we had been walking all day.

910,Giordano's,"let's start off this way. i am just evaluating this pizza against other chicago style pizza places. that means you have to love motz cheese. in case you don't know a chitown pizza, the style is basically toppings solidified within a ton of cheese, contained in a crust bowl. the cheese is everywhere. so, what's left to evaluate: cheese and topping. let me jump to the conclusions -- you can't beat giordano's crust. it's butter and delicious. if you you're a sausage man, you should hit up gino's. if not, then this is your place.",4,Negative

So we came to Girdano's after trying Gino's previously because I didn't want to truy 'stuffed crust', I wanted deep dish. Well their stuffed crust IS their deep dish- which you can get plain. I enjoyed Giordano's crust much better - very doughy and cooked perfectly with a soft inside and crispy outside.. Delious plain pizza - we didn't get anything stuffed inside.

With that said, instead of going on and on about the food, when I'm sure you have plenty of reviews to go by, I'll give first timers a few tips that I had to learn the hard way. 1) Do not, I repeat DO NOT, take a huge bite of your deep dish pizza, because it smells and looks so amazing (and took 35 minutes to arrive) that you just can't help yourself. Find a way to help yourself or you certainly will choke. The pizza is cheesy (like seriously) and the cheese expands in your mouth with each chew. And, it doesn't just break apart. You will swallow and still have half of that cheese in your mouth, trying to swallow more and more until it's all down. It's bad business, man. So, TAKE SMALL BITES. 2) Mak",4,Positive

Well needless to say im really surprised about all the positive reviews, to begin the crust on the pizza was soo 'crackery' by that i mean pretty much it was alot like eating a thick saltine cracker it would break apart easily i think most-likely has to do with the dough they use to make it. Next the pizza itself had very little to almost no sauce and a mountain of cheese... I mean don't get me wrong i love cheese but this portion was enough to elevate ones cholesterol sky high, needless to say i really like there decor and all however i don't understand why they make there customers wait almost half an hour for some reheated pizza?

I was a bit disappointed.  The pizza was good, don't get me wrong.  I just didn't think it was that great.  In fact I liked Sacramento's imitation a bit better.  Believe it or not the ingredients at Chicago Fire seemed to be of a higher quality and there seemed to be more care put into the pizza.  Plus it was cheaper.

This turned out to be smart choice since I only made it through 3/4 of my personal pie. That is to say, it was quite filling and tasty too I might add.

The crust was not corn meal but more buttery, think a buttery pillsbury croissant in the twist can. We also ordered calamari which was good. It was crispy on the outside and just  melts in your mouth. There was about 1-2 pieces that were a bit rubbery out of the whole plate. I think I expected more from the pizza.

Anyway, I decided that I must try Giordano's while visiting Chicago. I ordered pepperoni pizza and it even though the wait was long, it was Well worth it and it actually exceeded my expectations. It was delicious and sooo cheesy, which I love. I may not have other pizza from Chicago to compare Giordano's pizza too, but I loved it!

971,Giordano's,"Great.  This deep dish has the best crust, in my opinion of 'the big three' (Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's) - it is flaky in a good way, and adds just a bit of crunch to the otherwise gooey and squishy pizza. The sauce is sauce, not puree (like Gino's East) or stewed chunks (like Lou's), but has good flavor and just a bit of acidic bite.  The famous upper-crust is there if you look, but honestly, I don't taste or feel it when I eat it, and if I didn't look for it, I'd never know it was there.  The cheese, of course, is excellent as well.  This is perhaps the thickest slice of the big three deep dish pies. On a negative note, this location is stingy with toppings.  My recent visit included both Italian sausage on one pie and pepperoni on another.  There were, sadly, perhaps two",4,Negative

The pizza itself is really thick..layer after layer of cheese, way too many ingredients sandwiched in there, and yet you never taste them!

Firstly, it's extremely confusing that the official website lists this location under 130 E Randolph St but it's actually on 135 E Lake St. We placed a carry out order online for a sausage and mushroom pizza which went through fine, but when we went to the front desk (dine in) to ask for o",3,Positive

There are many locations all around the Chicago area.,4,Positive

The wait was long but nothing out of the oridnary even on a Saturday night withe Air and Water show going on. The pre- ordering that they do while you wait really minimizes the time that you have to wait once you get your table. Wait staff was friendly and attentive.

986,Giordano's,"Hour wait to get in and it was.... well, sort of worth it. I tend to think this place is a bit overrated, and their are other pizza shops with better pies. I was born in Chicago and grew up eating pizza in the Chi. The pie is deep dish and overloaded with cheese in the middle, tomato sauce, and minimal toppings (bummer) on the top of the stuffed pie. Customer service was not good at all. Not once did the waiter checkup on us once the pizza was out. I was without beverage for the 2nd half of my meal... I like to consider Giordanos as a parallel to Jim's Steaks in Philly. You go to Giordanos if you don't know anything about Chicago-style pizza and you are a visiting tourist.

I ordered a Chopped Salad & large Special Stuffed Pizza for delivery online. Because of the weight & thickness of this monster pie, cooking it would take a while. Wait time expectations would need to be adjusted accordingly. Even so, my order didn't take too long to arrive at my hotel.

There was just way too much going on, and none of it good. Too cheesy, up to a point where it was hard to eat. I imagine a depp dish crust to be crisp buy yet chewy with a nice give.

Again, no complaints about the place itself, i just can't say i enjoyed the flagship product.",2,Negative

If you live in Chicago I think you should definitely go there once or twice but there's much better deep dish pizza out there that is less bland.  If you really like deep dish check out Lou Malnati's -- their crust is amazing and their cheese & sauce is much better.",2,Positive

It is a very cheesy pizza and I would even suggest telling the waiter to go light on the cheese. It really makes no sense that there is so much cheese on a pizza. Kind of a turn off honestly. The crust is nice and doughy yet flakey. Very filling pizza. Even 'real men' would eat it with a fork/knife. If you are in a party of two please get the size lower than medium. I would assume that is a small. There is no way in the world that two people (man + woman) can finish a medium pizza. Too much food. All of that cheese doesn't help either.

The wait is LONG but well worth it. You can order drinks and apps at the bar while you're called which is great if you can fit in... The Service is decent. Don't expect the pizza to come out as quick as a brooklyn-style will, but believe me it's well worth it. (see pics) Will definitely return for some more when back in Chi-town!",4,Positive

But a good spot for all the goodness. We ordered to go, but the staff was very unprofessional, they were just scattered all over the place, like where you would find teenagers working after school and hanging out on their phone half the time while they're working... they wouldn't have gotten better ratings if we dined and had their service I'm sure.",4,Negative

We were told that we could pre-order our pizza while we waited in line but since we were not in a hurry we decided not to. 35 minutes from order to serve - well worth the wait. Small 10' is plenty for 4 regular eaters. Delicious tall, crispy biscuit crust and very very cheesy. Beer was cheap enough but I really wish they served Guinness. The waitstaff was fast and friendly. This place is super clean- not a speck of ick. I held back one star because the womens bathroom was clean. But it is very tiny, falling apart and impossible for a wheelchair. They certainly seemed to get enough traffic $ to fix that problem.",4,Positive

We of course got the deep dish, some morons who reviewed it who had never been there tried something else. STUPID. The pizza was damn good, the crust was weird but deep dish pizza crust is different. The cheese was excellent, tons of toppings, and the sauce was fantastic. If you're in Chicago visiting, go there for pizza. It's right across millenium park and close to the lake.

I added some black olives as well. I'm a fan of anchovies, but decided to get them on the side. The saltiness goes well when you break off the crust. Also got the greek salad. The pizza was really, good, but the top crust was a bit undercooked, so I couldn't eat it. The sausage is seasoned well and the sauce is good. It was a very good pizza.

We haggled and finagled and ended up deciding to have jalepeno and sausage pizza, the traditional deep dish style, and we ordered ahead and funneled into the bar for a beer while we waited for a table.

I'm a big fan of the cheese garlic bread. The most economical thing to do is to split a pizza with a few people, but sometimes we each do our own thing and order entrees. I would not recommend the baked mostaccioli - it is really disappointing. I prefer thin crust over the stuffed pizza since it's less of a brick in your stomach. But really, it doesn't matter what you eat here, you'll be in a food coma afterwards. Don't forget to take a mint or two on your way out. I think the service here is really hit or miss. Sometimes we have a great server, other times we are desperately trying to flag someone down to help us.",3,Negative

Since my Mother-in-law (MIL) was dropping off items for the party, I told her to take care of the confirmation. I received a second phone call at 3PM saying that I needed to confirm my party for tonight or it would be cancelled. WTF? I call back, and they said that they needed confirmation from me even though my MIL had already been there to drop off a load of junk for the party. Odd. 2. The bathroom needed to be serviced midway through our event. I found someone to take care of it immediately. 3. We put a credit card down on file. As the party",4,Positive

We got the stuffed pizza, with pineapple and ham. To tide us over for the 35 minute preparation time, we got a caprese salad. The caprese was made with what appeared to be ginormous slabs of mozzarella, pale unripened tomatoes and a few grassy strands of basil.

So what is Chicago Style Pizza?  Simply put its trying to get enough cheese into a single pizza to give yourself a coronary.  Its not your traditional pizza, because your cheese and toppings are mixed together, and you have your tomato sauce on top. You can Wikipedia the rest. Giordanos is something of mythic Chicago lore, this is where you can supposedly get some of the best Chicago Stuffed Pizza.

This was only my second trip to Chicago, and I didn't have any Chicago-style pizza last time. Getting a thick slice this time was a must on my to-do list. The 40+ minute wait was worth it in my opinion. The service was brisk, lacking and borderline rude, but the deep dish pizza was good enough that I brushed it off. You definitely only need one piece if you typically eat two pieces. I think everyone knows by now that Chicago-style is at least one inch thick and filled with 'toppings'.

We figured it was ok, so waited the hour and the delivery guy was right on time.  Unfortunately, he brought a large thin crust pizza (we ordered stuffed).  I called in and the woman paused for a moment (probably realizing that it was almost time for them to go home) and then told me 'no, that's not what you order",1,Negative

They told us it'd be a 45 minute wait and that you could pre-order at the window since it'd take just as long to make the pizza. I definitely suggest pre-ordering while you wait. It was worth it as we were seated at least 15 minutes before we got our pizza. The small pepperoni stuffed pizza was more than enough for two people to share. My thoughts on the pizza itself - holy cheese. I expected a stuffed pizza but the amount of cheese used was overwhelming.

I sometimes grab dinner at the Gold Coast stand at Union Station and the beef's are much larger and better ('juicier'). The fries were served unsalted in a large brown bag, and were hot and excellent in flavor and texture, the only issue is there were just not very many of them.

Really, really tasty burgers (have to love a place that tops their burgers with classic hot dog toppings, pickle spear included) and mediocre fries. I do enjoy the Merkt's Cheddar squeezed on, and the burgers are always pretty juicy, thanks to perpetually soaking half-cooked in a broth bath. The dogs are okay, and the beef is 'eh.'  The latter being a little flavorless and the the former being burnt to a crisp more often than not. I understand and embrace the 'char' aspect, but they go a little overboard here. The knocking aspect of Gold Coast Dogs is that they are brutally inconsistent from store to store.

Well I ordered a charbroiled dog with the dreaded tomato concoction on it.  Trays dropped!  Gasps of horror were emitted from all the connoisseurs dining on fine encased meats!  Buzzes and hushed tones of 'She ordered WHAT on her hotdog?'.  A silence fell on the establishment.  The manager came out from behind the counter and without a word pointed towards the exit.  I made my egress, head hung low, doing a walk of shame as if expelled from a military ac",4,Negative

Its not the brewed kind, it comes out of the soda fountain and it tasted like a freaking melted Popsicle. Avoid, unless you really like melted popsicles. I got all the Chicago dog toppings except the tomatoes. And all was good. Soft bun, good snap to the dog, sport peppers had a kick, perfect amount of mustard, mmmm! The fries were hot and crispy and were actually really good as well. I needed more ketchup though. I went back to the counter and asked for more ketchup and the guy working said '5 dollars' I replied with 'make ya holla!' and high fived him. He laughed and handed me a bunch. Mmm, chicago style dogs are now a favorite.",4,Positive
1197,Gold Coast Dogs,I don't know what everyone is complaining about. No I'm not a native but I brought my friend who was visiting from NY to try this place out. We both thought the Chicago hot dogs from this place was damn good. I would definitely come back here to try their hot dogs.,4,Negative

That said, GCD does not have the ambience of Portillo's on Ontario, but I go for the food.  To me,  GCD beef and fries are WAY superior. I don't eat hot dogs, so I can't comment on those.  But the combo menu is the way to go.     Nice, fast, friendly staff.   Same guy has been serving me there for years.",5,Positive

Everything on their menu looks delicious, but I love the option of building my own sandwich so that's what I went with, and the person I was with had the 'Scottsdale' which was really just a Reuben.

Goodwin's is just good, wholesome, fresh food that's somehow put together in a delicious way. Most of their stuff is pretty darn healthy, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's pretty darn tasty as well. I'm not sure why it took this long for Goodwin's to grow on me.

As far as I know their delivery range is pretty small, but they always accommodate a delivery to my office (at Jackson & Wacker) as long as there's a few sandwiches in the order. They are a little bit on a pricey side I suppose ($7 for the sandwich and a small side of chips, fruit, potato or pasta salad), but the sandwiches are excellent (MUCH better than a Subway or Potbelly's sandwich) so it's well worth it to stop by here every once in a while.",5,Positive

Overall, good food, okay service (only ordered for delivery), and okay prices.",4,Positive
1253,Goodwin's,"This place is amazing! They have avocado on almost every wrap and sandwich which i love. instead of fries most meals come with chips and salsa, a great healthy alternative. Oh, and when asparagus is in season they have a special sandwich with it. One word to describe this place : Totallyfreakingdelicious",5,Positive
1254,Goodwin's,"The location is easily missed and in an awkward basement setting, but besides that they have really tasty sandwiches and salads for a good price.  It is always packed at lunch time, but definitely worth the wait.  The food is really fresh and made right in front of you.",4,Positive
1255,Goodwin's,"Goodwin's is  a reliable, faux-healthy lunch option. Their wraps are great! I have never ordered a sandwich here--if I want a sandwich I just go to Potbelly and save myself $4. Their salsa is good, and the guacamole is good about 60% of the time. Yeah, not always consistent, but I can deal with it. Once it starts getting warmer out I'll be sad that my office is no longer a block away from Goodwin's...but thank goodness they deliver! I can't get through a summer without a weekly Lisa's Wrap.",5,Negative
1256,Goodwin's,"'Eat Fresh, Feel Good'.... the Goodwin's motto, and a decent one at that. However, given the chance to rename this dandy little loopy lunch spot, I'd just call it 'Goodwin's; FTW' aka 'Goodwin's; For the Win'. Duh. Sorry, I have to pander to the layman, too. They got a fab little formula working in their bi-level digs and thanks to my ardent lunching partner, the delightful (and healthy I might add) Kyle H., I got a warm introduction to the prescription for this 'winner' in specialty sandwiches, hearty soups, wholesome wraps and super salads. Goodwin's slants slightly toward the no-frills lunch enthusiast... you head down to the basement, hop in line, peruse the menu and then prepare to order cafeteria-line style with your tasty goods meeting you at the cashier. Grab your Nogales Tortilla ",4,Positive
1257,Goodwin's,"This is one of those places you go to and spend most of your lunch break waiting on your food. When its warm out, the line is usually out of the door. Whenever I have the urge to eat here I call my order in. I wait about 5-7 mins (thanks to the luxury of working not even half a block from this joint) and I walk right on over. Now that I have gotten the bad part out of the way..... The food here is great. I usually get the Key West Tortilla Wrap, which is basically chicken breast, pineapple, cheese, pico de gallo and mayo wrapped in your choice of a flour, spinach or wheat tortilla. They are all good, but I like the Spinach tortilla. All Wraps come with Guac, chips and salsa. The menu is great with lots of salads, wraps and sandwiches to choose from and prices are very reasonable.If your of",4,Positive
1258,Goodwin's,"Went here today for lunch upon the suggestion of a co-worker.  I was craving some good pastrami, and I've been meaning to try Perry's, but I heard it's a mountain of meat, but I'd go for it if it was really good pastrami....so ok, Goodwin's sounded like a good compromise.  Except NO PASTRAMI!!! What kind of deli place doesn't have all the major meat groups, I ask you!?  Sigh...oh well.  They did have turkey pastrami, which probably would have been ok. I decided to play it safe and get a Turkey Sandwich with guacamole and multi-grain bread. All in all, the igredients were fresh, but it was kind of lack-luster.  I did enjoy the multple side options and the service was friendly overall.",3,Positive
1259,Goodwin's,"Chips & guac come with your wrap... need I say more? Ok, well to say a little bit more - this place rocks. Call ahead if you don't want to wait in line. I get the Sedona without mayo (vegan), and add cucumber & pineapple to it... it's awesome. Love Goodwins. I can, and have, eat there every day of the week. The prices are really good too - $6.25 for a wrap AND chips & guac!",5,Positive
1260,Goodwin's,"Before I even get into the food here, let me first say that to the people that are frightened by the line - you should ORDER FIRST then go and pick it up! I never wait in line here for food. I go straight down the steps - pick up my order and go up the back steps where the you can come up to more seating. Anyway, moving on to the food. Most things that I've tried here are absolutely delicious.  Everything is fresh and made to order. I'm stuck on making my own sandwich from the sandwich board. However, The Vail is great and so is the Chicken Caesar Wrap. The salads are huge and great also.   I highly suggest that people try out this place and like I stated before order before you get there. Their menu is online for printing and it'll make your experience much better! Enjoy!",4,Positive

Tip: go down the incognito North door, not the South one; there you'll go deep below the Earth's crust like Persephone being lured by Pluto's promises of fresh ingredients made into salads, sandwiches, soups, and signature wraps! Okay, you may actually get held up waiting in the stairwell on your descent if you go during prime lunch time, because this place is very popular. But the wait will give you time to look at their menu and equivocate over 2-3 wraps or sandwiches like I did. I had my choice all made until I got closer to ordering and then saw the Specials chalk board. The soup was Spring Asparagus, so I called an Audible and got the 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup deal!

I can't wait to try other wraps on the menu!  Well done.",4,Positive
1263,Goodwin's,"Love Goodwin's! They have really good, fresh, healthy food. The wraps are a good size and tasty! They come with chips and salsa or you can get a small side salad.

Best bet is to go early or take a late lunch.",4,Positive
1264,Goodwin's,"Okay, if you are looking for a place that serves up hearty sandwiches and wraps, then look no further. Goodwin's is the place to go.  It kind of reminds me of a New York Deli -- the sandwiches are big and the place is always packed.   My favorites sandwiches are the durango and the brighton (there are about 15 to choose from).  The durango is the grilled chicken with avocado and provolone cheese and the brighton is a turkey with a layer of cranberry sauce and cream cheese on multi-grain bread.  I've also tried the Manhattan clam chowder, which had a fresh bold flavor. Be warned...this place is always busy.  If you are in the rush, phone in your order and pick it up.",4,Negative
1265,Goodwin's,Great place to grab a quick sandwich during lunch. Don't be scared away by the long line- they've got a system down at Goodwin's so you'll have your food within 5 minutes.  I've tried most of the sandwiches on the menu and everything is good.,3,Positive
1266,Goodwin's,"Goodwin's is a better-than-average spot for a sandwich or wrap in the Loop. When confronted with options such as Subway (ick), Jimmy John's (bland x 100) or Potbelly (just not as good as it used to be), I'll choose Goodwin's every time. My coworker and I had a craving for a big-ass deli sandwich from Perry's, but when we arrived, there was a sign on the door that said 'closed for remodeling', and next to it was a giant orange sticker from the City of Chicago that had a different story to tell. Feeling dismayed, we decided to traverse across the street to Goodwin's instead. She had never been here and it's been awhile for me, so it seemed like a good alternative.

Wraps and sandwiches are adorned generously with meats, cheeses, lettuce, and other condiments. My favorite wraps are the Fresno (asparagus and turkey) and Rosie's sloppy veggie wrap (black beans and pico de gallo). Wraps always come with a good portion of tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole.

Done. And it does take a bit longer because everything is made to order in front of you.  Seems worth it to me. The freshness of their ingredients is unparalleled. Everything is laid out for you to see, and if a certain item isn't up to their quality, they'll put up a few signs letting you know that and that they're hoping the crops improve, etc.  The Owner, I believe owns a farm in Wisco or is getting into farming to use his products.  That's amazing to me.

Fare wise, I have only had their sliders, which are okay.  They seem to have a tinge of sweetness that may be from the bun which is a bit interesting.  The thin cut fries we got at the latest visit were like those shoestring potatoes you get in the tin at the store - dry and crunchy.  No, tanks for nuh-tin.   I have to give Grace's kudos for having Two Brothers Domaine Dupage on tap.  I highly recommend you try a pint of this brew.  You'll be buying six packs of it at the store af",3,Positive

Potato skins, pretty good, but overpriced like everything else on their menu. Service, not so great either.  We had Robert who seemed pissed off at us from the start.  Not sure why, maybe cuz one of our friends asked if he could just start with a water, but that was before he ordered an app and the $12 mac n cheese!  He also was slow as hell, he",3,Negative

Don't expect too much from this place- the food is standard pub fare w/o that Whitefish sandwhich to choose from, the beer is slightly overpriced (but that's not the end of the world).

While I loaded my plate with a pile of roasted zucchini and squash just popping with color and scented with garlic and Parmesan, two upper middle aged women, who looked like they spent much too much time at Macy's makeup counter, offered loud, obnoxious critique of the food. 'This is terrible,' one said. 'This place is going down hill,' said the other. 'There's nothing here, what ",3,Negative
1310,Great Street Restaurant,"Usually buffets aren't my cup of sauce, but this was pretty alright.  There are two islands of food, one salads and another of entrees such as salmon, chicken, beef and vegetable melody, which consisted of broccolini and carrots.  I am always weary about food staying hot by over water, especially when that food starts with f and ends with ish.  The major reason for the low rating is for the service or shall I say, lack there of.  Running out of soda, okay no refills but water? And not as if su-waiters are standing around watching you eat.",2,Negative
1311,Great Street Restaurant,"The brunch buffet was excellent, and the dining room has nice views.  I went there a few times during a stay at the Renaissance Hotel, so I had an opportunity to note that the service is usually good but not great (had to keep chasing people down for coffee or the check).",4,Negative
1312,Great Street Restaurant,"Never. Ever. Eat here.  Unless you want to waste money. We arrived here on a Saturday night last summer to a completely empty restaurant.  That should have been the first clue.  Our sommelier (if he can even be called one) poured bits of cork into the first wine glass.  When we pointed this out, he kept pouring into the other glasses, then threw out the wine from the glass with the cork.  They never discounted the bottle or brough a new one.  In fact, they later overcharged us for it!  The other bottle of wine our group ordered was poured without even offering a taste (lest we find cork in that one too!). The menu left something to be desired.  I usually like to experiment, but the only appetizing thing I saw was the spaghetti.  It's hard to screw up spaghetti, right?  Well, they succeeded",1,Negative

1314,Great Street Restaurant,"Breakfast buffet here is a decent value at $22pp.  Great omelet station and lots of fresh fruit.  The cooked food, especially the breakfast sausage and hash browns, is ok too.  The ready-made pastries are more of a miss, and similar to the Costco variety. Service is good, atmosphere clean and quiet.  I probably wouldn't come again due to the options available in the area, but it's not bad!",3,Positive
1315,Green Apple,"My first opinion is this place is trying to do too much... Frozen Yogurt... Korean.. and Viet? Come on! Which one are you actually specializing in? The food was decent (considering it's location), my expectation for Asian food in downtown isn't very high. I ordered the bulgoki, and my friend ordered the pho. The bulgoki was okay, but a bit on the smaller portion? Or maybe I was just really hungry that day. Would come back, but not that often.",3,Negative
1316,Green Apple,"This stand has several names: Big Pho, Green Apple, Korean BBQ, etc. haha, they need to consolidate the names for their own sake. I had to enter in the address of the food court so that I could figure out how to write a review for this place. I'm not a connoisseur of Pho or Vietnamese food in general (as the other reviewers seem to be), but I do know good, hearty soup. This place has it and its cheap too. I think all the Pho runs between $7 and $9. I plan on trying the other stuff on their menu, but for right now, the cold weather place I'll be hitting up for delish Pho is Green Apple/BigPho/Korean BBQ Grill ;) The staff is  great and so polite. I've yet to have a bad experience here.",4,Negative
1317,Green Apple,"Great phos for a random Korean place in the loop, though its doused with MSG, I was pretty thirsty afterwards",4,Positive
1318,Green Apple,"My first pho experience happened to be here. Not sure if this is a good place to start for this wonderful dish but it just happened that way. I was walking down Mich Ave with a certain lovely lady, and pho was brought up,  and Yelp brought us here. The food court location (entrance is located on Lake right next to the McDonald's) made me a bit skeptical at first. The portions were pho-nominal and it all tasted great to me. I particularly enjoyed the brown sauce that it came with (similar to teriyaki) for mixing in. Bean sprouts and Asian basil came on the side. I enjoyed my first pho experience here. Now I will be searching out the next best place to get it in the city as winter is upon us. Truly warms the soul.",5,Positive
1319,Green Apple,"Green Apple is officially my favorite restaurant in the Loop! Yeah, lunch costs me at minimum $8 after tax, but it is worth every penny. Pho is very tasty and fresh.  The portion is not as large as the ones served in Viet Town on Argyle, but enough to fill you up during lunch. I've only had a Gom Tang for Korean food here.  I don't know what Gom Tang is supposed to taste like, but the broth was very mild and not salty.  This is great soup for me when I'm feeling under the weather. Best of all, the owners of the little restaurant in this food court are so generous and nice.  The owner's wife brought out extra rice and banchan without me even requesting these items.",4,Positive
1320,Green Apple,"Love love this place. I had a fierce craving for pho earlier and knew that finding a steaming bowl of beef soup deliciousness would be nearly impossible in the Loop. Thank goodness for Yelp (and for Tom and Angie X's review). Within 15 minutes, I was back at my desk and devouring the #9 steak pho. Mmm. I was also psyched to find that Green Apple offers up some of my favorite Korean dishes, like soondubu, chap chae, and bibimbap. A place that sells pho + Korean food + frozen yogurt is like something I would have come up with in my wildest dreams. Enough said. I still have to come back to try the Korean food, but I'm pretty sure I've found my newest fave lunch spot.",4,Positive
1321,Green Apple,"As many have mentioned, this place has multiple names and is located in a food court that reeks of fast food and depressing times.  If you can overlook these things, then you will be able to get pho in the Loop, which is nearly impossible.   As I'm not a pho expert, I can't speak to whether or not this is authentic.  HOWEVER, I always leave full and in want of a nap rather than returning to work.  The staff is so nice!  They have mango smoothies!  The bibimbap is on par with it being a food court, but not a shady one!  So, just go here, try it out, you will definitely enjoy it, even if your clothes smell like pho/Popeye's/McDonald's/orange chicken afterwards.  What's the alternative?  Getting the food carryout so that you can enjoy your pho, jap chae, bibimbap and smoothie on the go. So tr",3,Positive
1322,Green Apple,"Five stars for just what I needed...pho on a shopping trip!  It was a depressing food court, as Jessie F. says, but worth the trip inside.  Seems to get a lot of neighborhood people, though, which speaks highly of its food.  The service was wonderful.  The proprietor even brought me a 'real' bowl when he found I was going to eat at the little table on the mall side, instead of carry out.",5,Negative
1323,Green Apple,"A Korean fast food restaurant in the Loop!  Located on the 2nd floor of the Lake/Clark St food court. Authentic Korean food owned and operated by Koreans.  I had the BeeBimBop and it was delicious.  Vegetables were varied. The hot sauce was on side so u can control the spiciness.  Highly recommend checking out.  They didn't have a carry out menu for the Korean food, just the Vietnamese Big Pho side.",5,Negative

1325,Green Apple Cafe,"Great little place actually, really no complaints. . . Other than they ring up the wrong price for the food everytime I go in there.  Coincidentally it is always higher.  Granted it is only 50 cents here and 80 cents there, but if they are doing this to everyone they are making a boat load more money than they advertise their prices at. So keep an eye on the woman at the cash register.  I know I am being stingy but it happens everytime. I can't help feeling I am slowly being robbed. Otherwise a great place, Ha!",3,Negative
1326,Green Apple Cafe,Love their mango/peach/pineapple yogurt smoothie. I've had the turkey and veggie sandwhich. Very good for a decent price. Much better than Au Bon Pain.,4,Negative
1327,Green Apple Cafe,"Surrounded by chain restaurants, this place holds its own, despite no longer being able to make sandwiches (wraps-only these days).  If you're looking for a sandwich, however (the California Club is delicious), just hop over to the outpost across the street on the first floor of the Smurfit Stone building.",5,Negative
1328,Grillers,"Grillers is cash only so my trip today was a treat considering I'm usually only a plastic purchaser. I had the veggie burger and onion rings. The onion rings are pretty standard, and certainly would have been better with tempura batter, but the veggie burger was very, very tasty. I got it with everything on it, mayo, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and ketchup, it was pretty perfect. The bun is large, making it look like this is the biggest burger you've ever had, and is fluffy, covered in ground sesame. Overall, this place seems great for its location. The only competition it faces right now is Subway, which gets old very fast. Grillers has a LARGE variety of choices so if they got a credit card machine, they'd really be bumpin.",4,Positive
1329,Grillers,"Tucked at the very end of the food court in the Metcalfe Building (next to the perennial 'Haifa Cafe Coming Soon' sign), Grillers is a small oasis for federal employees and financial bankers alike.  Open for breakfast only to those who work in Metcalfe or walk through the metal detectors and for lunch to the general public, Grillers serves a vast array of American fare.  Daily breakfast specials such as pancakes with hash browns and a meat, or french toast with hash browns and a meat cost $4.20 including tax.  The gyros won't have you thinking Mr. Greek, and the burgers won't have you thinking Portillo's, but the pricing and friendliness of the main cashier won't spoil your day. I WOULD advise patrons to skip the fries.  They are consistently below average, though not enough to make me thi",4,Negative
1330,Eat & Drink,"Directly across the street from the office so it is very convenient. Got the basic chicken fried rice, which was good but I had to add lots of soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce. Got an egg roll as well, which was absolutely delicious. Not bad for the wallet, in which my meal was about $6 for a small order which was huge! They have various lunch specials as well for decent prices. This place is very small and you might miss it so keep your eyes peeled!!!!",4,Positive
1331,Eat & Drink,"Admittedly, I have yet to be to China town...but this is the only good Chinese food I've had in Chicago so far. Very similar to NYC Chinese takeout. The food is good, plentiful, and inexpensive. Lunch dishes come with rice for around $6 and it's more than enough for 2 people. You should definitely go to their place too because it's a trip. You basically stand in tight quarters, yell out your order, and then they get it to you in a few minutes. Very informal. Soup Nazi-ish but not mean. Chinese Food For You! 2 Years!",4,Negative
1332,Eat & Drink,We frequent this little joint on our lunch hour occasinally and it's pretty good. Not bad not amazing just good chineese at a decent price. If your going to eat in be warned that it's pretty warm during hotter days. The sesame chicken is pretty tasty as well. Prices are decent and you get a good value for your money.,4,Positive

1334,Eat & Drink,"This place is a bit grimy, and during a slow weekend lunch hour, with only three customers in the restaurant, I didn't enjoy the owner (?) arguing with me when he messed up my request for an egg roll.  He was insistent that I had requested crab rangoon.  I distinctly remember telling him that I wanted an egg roll, to mention nothing of the fact that I would never order anything containing crab or anything that is crab-flavored; I'm just not a fan of crab.",2,Negative
1335,Eat & Drink,"We call it the shack! popular lunch spot with decent food that beats all the other fast 'chinese' place in the loop. Get the small size because the large can feed an entire family. The food is mostly made to order and they can customize things for you. The smoothies are also good. Yes, it may not look very clean, has been shut down by the health department a few times, and the woman behind the counter may seem to be a little stern, but that's why it's called the shack.",3,Negative
1336,Eat & Drink,"Known affectionately as 'The Shack' by my former colleagues, I remembered this gem while looking for lunch downtown today.  This tiny place has an extensive menu of fast Chinese food, bubble tea, smoothies, and lychees.  You order at the counter, hear the order repeated in Chinese to the kitchen staff, and have your food within minutes - steaming hot!  This place is geared towards the downtown lunchtime crowd - people who need food fast and are returning to their desks to eat it.   Today I had the sesame chicken lunch special (it came with fried rice and a crab rangoon) and a kiwi lychee.  The chicken was thoroughly yummy and the crab rangoon was freshly fried.  FRESHLY FRIED!!!  It was a little heavy on the cream inside and not so full of crab meat, but it was good nonetheless.  The lyche",4,Positive

Since pretty much everything is under $10 here, don't stop by yourself for lunch if you don't have any cash. The place is very run down and gross looking, but despite this I was desperate to try it as the Yelp reviews label this place as Americanized Chinese and I have been searching for just that in this area for forever. I guess it's Americanized Chinese. I ordered the chicken lo mein, hoping for the ramen-type noodles I've been craving since I moved here. Every other Chinese place in River North has gross, weird tiny thin noodles labeled as lo mein. That's certainly not the case here. They don't have ramen noodles or weird thin noodles either - instead they literally use SPAG",1,Negative
1338,Eat & Drink,"This is the weirdest looking place. A hot, smelly hut on the side of the road, but the food is very good at a normal price. I kept it simple for my first time around and went with sweet and sour pork. They cooked it not 5 feet away from me in about 10 minutes. Most Chinese places mass produce the food and leave it sitting out all day, so I appreciated the fresh grub. The portions were generous as expected. I thought I would never go to this place and now I find myself coming back.",4,Positive
1339,Eat & Drink,"In my opinion, Eat & Drink is the single most solid/tasty made-to order Chinese take out in the loop. I can't stress enough what a difference it makes NOT to receive your meal from a chaffing dish. LOVE the shrimp fried rice, the small size is ridiculously large - enough for this man to eat two meals out of. The smoothies are awesome.",4,Positive
1340,Eat & Drink,"This has been the only place in the city where I've been able to find sweet and sour tofu.   While I wouldn't recommend eating in, this place is great to get in and grab a quick bite to go.  The outside might put some people off -- it's a small shack (that used to be a hot dog joint).  I've been in there a ton of times at all times of the day, and it's always clean and the people who work there are always friendly. The food is freshly made, and they're willing to take requests.  For $7 you can get a heaping portion of an entree, fried rice and either a crab rangoon or egg roll.   One of the best 'fast food' Chinese places around, and certainly a better value than some chain place like Panda Express.",5,Positive
1341,Eat & Drink,"I've been coming here for the last 11 years and have never gotten anything free. The owner knows who I am and knows I come here often. He's a nice guy but seems very cheap!

Today, I looked back and wonder why I ate so much of there crap food.",2,Negative
1342,Eat & Drink,"Oh, I don't know whether to love or hate Eat & Drink. I've walked by this place numerous times-- put off as well as intrigued by the fact that the restaurant is a green shack about the size of a living room. But I decided to give it a shot today because I was craving some good Asian food. I wanted wonton soup, and I also wanted to be daring by trying their 'most requested item,' the hot dog fried rice. I was so excited that even the weird chemically cucumbery smell that hit me when I picked up the food didn't diminish my excitement. But it should've. My wonton soup was bland and the wontons were mushy. My fried rice contained what seemed like less than one sliced Oscar Meyer hot dog and the rest was just unflavorfully mushy rice. I will eat pretty much anything and I will rarely let food g",1,Positive

Hot & sour soup - pretty standard - I think theirs is vegetarian though so lacking some of the flavor and ingredients (no woodear, meat, etc.) Potstickers - a bit greasier than usual and less crunchy than I like (one side crisp / one side soft) - the sauce could use a bit more ginger.",3,Positive
1344,Eat & Drink,"The Chinese food is delicious and the large portions are indeed large enough for two meals.  If you ask them to withhold the vegetables in your entree, I think they feel obligated to add more meat to fill-up the container so bonus.  The food is quite salty so beware.  My only complaint was that I ordered online, added the tip to my total, paid by credit card and saw on my receipt from the delivery man that they wrote in another tip (5%) for themselves on top of the tip I already paid. The more I order from this place, the more annoyed I get.  I ordered online again and noted I had a coupon for 15% off my order over $20.00.  The order was more like $40.00.  They didn't apply the coupon at all.  Why hand-out flyers if you're not going to honor them?  Also, I hate getting a phone call after e",3,Negative

1349,Edwardo's Natural Pizza Restaurant,"Ordered the appetizer sampler and spinach deep dish pizza.  The appetizer sampler was tasty and came with breaded mushrooms, mozzarella sticks and spinach mozzarella sticks.  The spinach mozzarella stick were a nice change from the your everyday mozzarella stick and were quite tasty.  Our deep dish pizza came out in about 35 minutes and was ok.  The toppings and spinach were quite good its just that our crust was a bit too hard on the bottom...tough to bite and really tough to slice with a knife type hard.  I noticed some of my fellow Yelpers took issue with the cleanliness of this place...the folks at this restaurant must be reading as the place looked quite clean.",3,Negative
1350,Edwardo's Natural Pizza Restaurant,"I ordered from this Edwardo's once and have never gone back since.  The deep-dish Spinach was horrible!  Something just wasn't right with the cheese, it was as if they mixed something really foul tasting with the mozzarella, I couldn't exactly put my finger on it but it just really gave the whole pizza an awful after-taste.  It's really a shame, I remember going to one of these years ago out in Elmhurst and thought it was fantastic.",1,Negative
1351,Edwardo's Natural Pizza Restaurant,"Although the service is haphazard (if ordering over the phone, expect 10-20 minutes more than they told you), the pizza is surprisingly tasty.

When I visited here the entire restaurant had one waitress covering all the tables @ around 5:30PM.  Granted there were only two tables when I walked in, but by the time I left (at around 7:30PM) there were at least 15 tables with only one waitress covering the whole restaurant.  Needless to say, the service was slow. Pizza itself is un-amazing.  Bland sauce combined with 'fresh' mozarella cheese and uninspiring bread.  If I were to make a pizza from scratch at home, my oven would make a better one.  I was hoping to taste the good 'Chicago-style' pizza, and what I got was something worse than Papa John's. Summary... bad pizza, bad service, overpriced.  Don't visit.",1,Negative

Absolutely no original dishes. All I read about was their Benedict. Off the menu. We ordered their seasonal pancakes, multi berry. It was just a plain pancake, and moments later they brought to the table a dish with thawed frozen berries to pour over the plain pancake. That is terrible. Never again. Eggy's, why would you change a menu when the menu reviews were so positive? It's a shame.",1,Negative
1362,Eggy's Diner,"A very average breakfast experience here. The breakfast menu is pretty limited and the entrees were nothing to rave about about. I had the two eggs, hash browns and toast. The eggs had too much pepper on them. Wouldn't you let the customer handle if they want salt/pepper on their eggs? The hash browns were greasy. It took quite a long time for us to get our entrees although the place was not crowded. With Wildberry so close, I can't imagine coming back here anytime soon. I hope the lunch menu is better than their breakfast!",2,Negative

It's a large slab of maple-glazed pork belly, cooked to fork-tender, on a slab of crumbly, delicious cornbread, with poached eggs (of course) and a brown butter hollandaise, in which I think I tasted a little citrus.

C) The service was so stripped down, with inexperienced waitstaff, that dawdled the absolute VAST majority of the time.  Every table was looking around looking for their server.  I watched our food be plated and served up in the window, while our server kinda aimlessly walked around the room ignoring everyone.

Our waitress (possibly the owner) was sweet as pie. She has a little one herself and knows very well how difficult it can be to dine with children. She even brought my daughter a toy to play with mid-meal. They get a few stars just for being kid friendly. The food was average.  I had eggs and pancakes, which were edible, but nothing special.

Nevertheless, we've enjoyed our meals and continue to go back. For breakfast, we've tried the Green Eggs + Ham, the Garden Omelet, and the Benedict, all of which were tasty. However, I thought the Green Eggs + Ham was too mushy and needed some extra ingredient for texture. My boyfriend ended up eating that, and I ate his omelet. I really enjoyed the omelet, and I'm not even a big egg person. So far, my favorite breakfast item is still Peter and the Wolf. His is the Benedict.

Meh: Gluten free, vegan banana walnut choc chip bread.  Pricey for $6.50! Burger.  Not great, but not bad.  Hits the spot if you're hungry. BLEH!: Green eggs and ham.  This dish was super acidic and not satisfying at all.  My suggestions: more fatty meat is needed to cut through the acid, remove the onions, and serve with biscuit/toast to soak up the juices and grits.

While I enjoy Einstein's bagels and its salads (one salad is often two meals), I have a big concern about this new location.  Mainly, its service.  The current set-up is inefficient.  Customers place their order with a staff person who enters it electronically.  You then move past the bagel display, attempting to avoid anyone who may be glued to the glass trying to figure out which bagel is calling them, to the register.  This is all of 5 feet away.  The person at the register says your name (because you've given it to",2,Negative

I love the madras curry flavor and England is one place to get it. What we actually got was a different story - they served the fries next to a bowl of chunky potato curry that was not very saucy. We actually asked our server if she was kidding us. Did they expect us to skewer the curried potatoes with our 'chips'? I ordered one of the winter special drinks - called a cinnamon toast.

It's highly vegetarian-friendly for being a British pub, with amazzzzzzing Veggie burger, really good appetizers like Bruschetta, Potato Croquettes and Spring Rolls. Just a quick warning - most of their soups have Chicken broth and their 'Indian vegetables' have Chicken broth too.

The place attracts a decent after work crowd; however, it thins out by around 7. Good selection of beer here, with average prices. We tried a few appetizers, which were okay, but not great. The nachos featured too many chips and not enough topping. For $13.50, I expect a heaping amount of toppings. The guac had a LOT of lime in it. I like lime and all, but it should not be the only flavor I taste. Pretzels were nice and warm and come with a grain mustard - this was my favorite out of the ones we tried.

One beef that I have with the place is that they don't take reservations or seat you until your party is there in full. We had a lunch meeting and were waiting for the whole party, but wanted to order some appetizers, but they wouldn't seat us. Once our full party arrived we were finally seated, but chose not to get appetizers (lost revenue for Elephant!). The food was surprisingly good and the service was adequate. I wouldn't say we got the best service in the world as our drinks were empty during half of our meal, but then again the server took the drinks off our bill! It's worth a try if you're in the area and looking for a pub with good food.",3,Positive

The waitstaff is super friendly, almost to a fault, but considering how busy they get, you should probably be grateful it's one extreme and not the other. If you go: it's crowded and you will very likely have to wait. The Guinness is pretty decent. The calamari is tender and served with a yummy, yummy sauce.

The green beans were barely cooked and the mashed potatoes were very disappointing. My husband got the fish and chips. He chose the cod, which had absolutely no flavor and the breading was barely crispy (very doughy). The 'chips' tasted stale and as if they had freezer burn.

The third time that I ate there it took so long to get our food that we asked for a to go container with it, because my 1 hour lunch was over before any of our food arrived. The waiter apologized profusely, but that didn't fix the extensive wait. The decor is out of date, but it's not what I would classify as dingy or bad.

A Caesar salad w/ grilled salmon.  It was very tasty.  Still no beer though.  The waiter actually came by, let me know that they were 'preparing' my beer.  What?!?

1425,Elephant & Castle,"I was going to the Chicago Theatre to see a show and wanted to grab a quick drink and a snack.  I just happened to see a meter spot open up right in front of E & C.  It was a busy Saturday night and the bar was full, so we sat at the bar.  The crowd was a conglomeration of out of towners and others waiting to see some shows.  I had the meatloaf, my friend the chicken plank appetizer.  They both were just ok, the taste of the food being nuked put me off a bit, but the great bartender and the 15 yr. Glenlivet put me back on track a bit.",3,Negative
1426,Elephant & Castle,"Bleckh! Not like this is the restaurants fault but the patio has go to go! Sitting there listening to the screetching and squealing of the train going by 10 feet above my head every 3 minutes was like listening to fingers on a chalk board. Well, why didnt we just sit inside, you ask? There was a wait and we were in a hurry. To add to my experience that wasnt off to a good start, I ordered Guinness Stew and was accidentally served a big pile of poo. They tried to disguise the look by sprinkling some chopped tomatoes and green onion on it. The first and only other time I had Guinness stew was in the originating country of the dish; Ireland. And it was good! tender juicy, melt in your mouth pieces of beef mingling in a hearty sauce with tender root veggies all served in a crock. What I got at",3,Negative

I'm so glad we agreed to meet at 11:30 instead of 12 because people started pouring in at 11:45 and by the end of the meal I felt like our waitress was trying to rush us out a little bit. If you meet somebody for lunch, either meet early or late unless you don't mind waiting around. I got a good look around and I really liked the decor and the whole ambience of the place, and I love the faux fireplace that we ended up sitting by, a little bit of romance I say.

1430,Elephant & Castle,"This restaurant is like if an ill-contrived fledgling English Pub failed at Epcot took to the entire nation and planted itself in major cities, attracting people who don't know any better looking for true British fare only to find cookie-cutter menus of very few traditional English foods, merely cluttered with salty typical-American entrees such as a chicken sandwich, or a burger. They do have this thing which seems like a popover but they call it a Yorkshire and it has slivers of super-salty meat which taste like they are from a can. Its really gross. Consider yourself warned!",2,Negative
1431,Elephant & Castle,"I've been wavering on this one, but the truth is, I *have* experienced better, and right nearby in the Loop. Elephant & Castle holds itself to be a 'British Pub' ostensibly because they serve fish and chips.  Ah, what the Brits must think of us.   The beer selection was decent (mostly 'macro'-type brews) and our bartender was very friendly and attentive, it's just that this place is... nothing special.  There are so many other (arguably better) places for you and your coworkers to go for a drink after work. To summarize (for you Gaelic speakers in the crowd) Elephant & Castle can Poag Mahone.",2,Negative
1432,Elephant & Castle,"We went here for a Sunday lunch.  The parking is usually okay for Sundays around here and it is very close to all kinds of public transportation and a very short distance to Millennium Park.  There was hardly anyone in there - probably because it was a Sunday.  The fish and chips were just okay- I have gone to a different location and they seemed better. Kid Friendly - for the most part.  They do have high chairs and were accommodating (but, it wasn't busy).  There is a limited kids menu with a few items.  The only part?  No changing table in the bathroom.  Noise level seemed fine to have my son, but he was being pretty quiet too.",3,Negative
1433,Elephant & Castle,"The closest thing to a British public house in the Loop (and there are 3 more in the general downtown area to choose from). They have many of the imported brews from the U.K., some on tap. The fare for a meal is also reminiscent of that from the British Isles. It's the place I'd go for fish and chips pre or post theatre (in the Randolph St, area) or for a place to go if you attend any of the offerings at the Cultural Center, Millennium Park, or Gallery 37's Theater. Be prepared for a crowd and a possible long wait in line depending on the hour of day (there's a loyal after-work and student clientele that frequent it.)",3,Negative

1436,Elephant & Castle,"This is a traditional looking British pub with a good beer selection. I was excited to see that they had Guinness 250 on draft when it first came out during the controversy (it was bad, but it was fun to give it a try). There aren't a ton a bars in this area, so it's nice to have this place as an option after seeing a play in the theatre district. Downsides? The music has been terrible when I've been here. I don't mind techno, but seriously, it's just not appropriate for a British pub like this. Secondly, although the actual bar is nice, the rest of the place has the feel of a Bennegins or similar chain restaurant. Maybe it's the carpeting or something.",3,Positive
1437,Elephant & Castle,"I know I know, I'm usually a bit too generous with the stars, but this location gets some kudos for the service. I'll explain in a moment. We randomly picked this place because we were wandering around das Loop in the rain and we needed food and a dry environment. Even though it was busy, we were seated right away, and the host was nice. The food was good! Comforting chain food. Two out of three of us had burgers, I had the fish and chips, and the lame one with us had a turkey sandwich (where's the sense of adventure in a turkey sandwich?). We're the kind of people to sample each other's food, and it was all good. Here's a heavy suggestion: ORDER THE SWEET POTATO FRIES. THEY ARE THE WIN. But that only qualifies this location for four stars. The FIFTH star goes for our waitress. I'm kicking",5,Positive

1440,Elephant & Castle,"If this place weren't so darn busy every day after work, I'd go here all the time...oh and if I had money. This is a bar/restaurant that has genuinely good food.  It is pretty much all British Classics, as they call it.  It's not 'bar food.'  Yeah, they have excellent burgers and to-die-for chicken tenders with homemade chips, but they also have shepherds pie, bangers and mash, fish n' chips and the list goes on... They have plenty of drinks to choose from, but they've been telling me for 2 years now that their blender is broken.  Um, yeah, how bout you fix that so I can get frozen margaritas again?!  k, thanks. It can get a little pricey, but it's definitely worth it.",4,Positive
1441,Elephant & Castle,"Hit or miss for me.  I went for lunch during the week - naturally crowded and tried the curry.  Not good at all - way too little flavor and too much liquid for the rice (or not enough rice).  Went again for lunch on a weekend (so much better without the crowd) and tried one of the sandwiches with much better success.  My friend had the mashed potatoes and they were real - not instant, which is a plus.  Service was great both times and the atmosphere is nice - not many sit-down places in this price range over on this side of the loop.",3,Positive
1442,Elephant & Castle,"What a waste of space in the loop!  This place was a let down in every possible way.  We had to ask 3 times before our teeny bopper brought us glasses of water, and we had to hunt down our own napkins and silverware.  Huh, get bent!!  The only thing half decent was the warm pretzels and mustard appetizer.  If not for them, this place would only get 1 star.  Our entree of Chicken/Veggies with Penne pasta was terrible.  Don't bother with this place.....",2,Negative
1443,Elephant & Castle,"Homey, welcoming place to spend some time having a meal and a beer.  I thought the atmosphere here was pleasant, dark enough to make you feel like it was okay to have a drink and relax, and homey enough to make you feel that you were sitting in a pub in England.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich, which was pretty good, and some sweet potato fries (which are hard not to be good!); but they also had some good comfort fare on the menu.  All in all, it's a nice place to enjoy a casual meal and beer on a cold night!",4,Positive

I've had shepherd's pie, steak and ale pie, curry fries, and a couple other items here, and all have been just fine. The place can get pretty loud, and it's usually a little full, especially on Friday, but if you're looking for something hearty for lunch, it's a really good spot, especially on a colder day. I don't know if I would want to take down a lot of shepherd's pie on a nice Chicago August day.",3,Positive

1447,Elephant & Castle,"You've got to be kidding me!  This place is a bad reflection of what an English Public House is ... the beer selection is decent, but the food is an afterthought at best.   It's like a Walt Disney version of a pub ... and not in a good way.",1,Negative
1448,Elephant & Castle,"I went here a bunch of times during the 2 weeks of staying in Hotel71, which is right down the street from one of their locations. Pretty much it's regular bar/ pub food. Burgers and wraps with regular appetizers like quesadillas. The food is nothing special, but really hits the spot if you're hungry and in a rush to eat. The food always came out quickly and well prepared. My main problem with Elephant & Castle is the wait staff. I went about half a dozen times and had a different waiter/ waitress each time. You would think that at least one of them would have given us good service, sadly that did not happen. Each time our waiter/ waitress forgot something, the silverware, the drinks, our appetizer.

I like that they have fireplaces to warm you up on cold Chicago winter nights. Food is pretty good. I have only had their chicken pot pie (delicious), but my boyfriend had their steak and he said it was really good. Love it how his steak came with beans, fries and onion rings!

I stopped here Friday with my parents because my dad needed some relief after my mom and I tore up State Street.  I had a bloody and a Miller - both par for the course.  My mom and I split pub pretzels which were very tasty (especially that mustard - rock!) but they kind of reminded me of donuts (not that that is a BAD thing).   The service was spot-on and I loved the English pub decor.  As a loop lady ALWAYS on the lookout for a happy-hour spot, I will be back to this bar very soon.",4,Negative
1452,Elephant & Castle,Stopped by here two weeks ago for a few drinks and some appetizers with an old friend. Great bar for a happy hour in the loop.  The bartenders were very friendly and talkative.  Having 312 on tap is always nice and they had a good variety of appetizers to choose from.  I went with the pick any three for something like 18 dollars. Not cheap but not horribly over priced either.

1459,Elephant & Castle,"I have been to this location twice..once for a private party downstairs and once for after work drinks.  Cheesy holiday decorations aside, this place is a pretty safe bet if you're in the area.  The private party was done very well and they appetizers were super yummy.   They were also able to accommodate a party of 6 with no problem on a weeknight and they have a good selection of beer available.  I tried the chicken quesadillas which weren't the best I've ever eaten but they did the job after two quick drinks.   I would definitely stop back in here to try some of their other menu items.",3,Positive

1461,Elephant & Castle,"I've been too tough on E&C. Sure, it's not going to give any new revelations on comfort food, but I'm glad that it's here, and even more glad that I work near here again. The chicken pot pie was tasty after a long day of work, but a bit of a small portion. Crust was nice and crispy, but I couldn't care less for green beans and (even) the garlic mashed potatoes that came with it. Just fill me up on pot pie! Service was really quick, and I love the 20 oz. Imperial Pint pours. The Guiness was just what the Weatherman ordered, and went perfectly with the chix pot pie. I am definitely going to make this a lunch and afterwork pop-in staple, now that I'm downtown again.",3,Positive
1462,Elephant & Castle,"It's always pretty crowded in here for lunch, which is surprising considering that they only have kinda average bar food.  It may be because they don't accept reservations, which is a pain. Anyway, I've had some decent appetizers and burgers, but nothing really memorable.  Recently I tried to switch it up a bit and ordered the fish and chips.  I was disappointed-- the cod fillets are about 3/4 of an inch thick, but, about half of it was breading. Greasy, greasy, breading.   Next time I'll play it safe and stick with a burger.",3,Negative
1463,Elephant & Castle,"Ah, I have fond memories of this place, which was the default after-work watering hole when I worked in a futures brokerage down the street. Good, solid, Americanized pub fare, but you really must try the Guinness Stew when it's cold outside; SO blasted good. The service can be hit or miss, but overall, I've been pretty satisfied. Now if they would just bring back the beer and cheese soup!!",4,Positive
1464,Elephant & Castle,"Food: The food is average. I ordered Fish n Chips. The fish was cold, but the fries were hot. Facility: The place is cramped and small.

Employees: They hurry you along and then bring the check way too fast. Cleanliness: The place could use a good cleaning. Even the entrance way was dirty.

The beer selection is partially British (well done on that) but whats with the shamrocks? HELLO, shamrocks are Irish!! That makes me mad. But, whatever. Bottom line is that I'd rather eat here than in my own local pub back in England. For booze, its a tough call. I guess the prices are pretty decent and the staff are friendly. I wish my mothers' shepherds pie was as tasty as this places, but hey that's life. As for the 'bang on' slogan?- leave that for the chavs and Londoners please.",3,Positive

But on a recent night when we wanted to grab one more night cap before heading home, we found ourselves wandering in and sliding up to the bar.

We were able to order some food and while I am not sure if it was the time of night or if this thing was just so darn good, but the Highland Bread Pudding was absolutely amazing (warm and gooey with fresh whipped cream)!

The evening was further proof that good company and good conversation is what really matters, and can make a great time in the a less-than-great place. I don't consider myself a cheapskate in the slightest, but $16 for two drinks is a little steep if there's no liquor or food involved. The service was hit or miss.

Because we were treated exactly the same. I've never had a bitchy waitress in my life. And maybe no one showed up at her halloween party or something who knows what could explain her rudeness to us. We complained to management about her. But if she's still there and you happen to go, good luck, she's got short brown hair, skinny type.

The long beans that came with it did not have any flavor whatsoever.

I thought the service was perfectly fine, not awesome but not unfriendly or slow. I had bangers and mash, pretty much my standard British pub meal and was not disappointed. The bangers were authentic and yummy, mash and beans were as expected. My London Porters Jack & Cokes were fine too, although my last Jack & Coke was kind of a stingy pour.

I go here strictly because it reminds me of London... well, as much as it can.  I've only sat at the bar but every time I go here it's great.  It's not your typical party bar obviously, but it's just a quaint little pub where you can sit and a have a beer after work (or in the afternoon!).  I always get Strongbow when I'm there... it's kind of expensive but it's a cider beer so that is to be expected.   I've always had good experiences as far as service and everyone I take there loves it.  I'll have to check out the food next time I go!  But if you just want to sit at the bar with good company and good people",5,Positive
1487,Elephant & Castle,"In Chicago for business, this pub was located a block down from the hotel and we were thristy for some beers...the name sounded cool, so we stopped in.  I love the selection of British taps...Fullers is well represented, as well as Smithwicks, Guinness and Strongbow (mix the two for a Black Velvet...they pour a mean one here).  Additionally they serve a few domestics like the local 312 from Goose Island Brewery, and Bell's Oberon (yum). The pub fries were great with a side of mayo, not overly greasy and cooked to perfection.  We also had a large plate of nachos that complemented our beers nicely. The service was excellent, and the bartenders play their own mixes over the speakers...Belle and Sebastian was playing loudly, which was a nice change from the usual bar music. There are a few loc",4,Positive
1488,Elephant & Castle,"This place is alright... if you're desperate. I tried this place out for lunch and drinks with a big group and this place was awful. When we were first seated, there was this awful smell that smelled like dog crap. Our waitress was really crabby. Like I said, I went with a big group (which meant automatic 18 percent tip added to the final bill) but yet the waitress was incredibly rude and bitchy. I noticed they had a chicken sandwich special on their board and when I asked questions about it she said that she didn't know what was in it and then made up some bull**** lie that they were all out of the special (I knew this was a lie because we came in when the place first opened). She then took forever to get us our drinks and food and never once did she apologize. Further, she was nice to ev",1,Negative
1489,Elephant & Castle,"I stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chi town for a business trip and had breakfast as well as an evening drink and desert here. It is a local pub with a busy evening crowd that is lively. The dining room is actually pretty inviting, and mirrors a living room, with book shelves, comfy chairs, etc. It is kind of dark, but what you would expect from a pub. I had a nice breakfast here of a veggie omelet, fruit, whole wheat bread and decent coffee. It was fresh, fast and the service was very nice. It was fine for a breakfast. I also came down to have a drink with a coworker and some desert. The desert was really good, some kind of apple and berry crisp with ice cream. The drinks were WAY overpriced for this type of place! A cosmo was $12 and a double of whisky (you needed a double, otherwise",3,Positive
1490,Elephant & Castle,"Three blocks east of work, so we decided it would be an adventurous stop on our part to start happy hour there. The sharing plates are tasty and reasonably priced, as is the beer. The 'but...' factor? I think my coworker said it best when we walked in: 'um, is it just me or does it smell like old people in here?' no offense to the geriatric, but he was right. Again, close to a ton of places in the loop (across from the Bank of America building -easy ATM access!). Fun crowd. But that smell...",3,Positive
1491,Elephant & Castle,"Decent at most.  Since there are hardly any casual sit down restaurants in the Loop for lunch, I have to say it is decent.  I got a steak salad one time and it was gross.  The whole salad was warm.  Not appetizing at all.  And I am NOT a picky eater in the slightest.   One time my roommate got quesadillas for lunch and paid $2 extra for guacamole and they literally brought her a thimble of it.  She asked for more since she was paying extra and the waitress got really snippy with her.  Said something along the lines of 'UM avocados are expensive.  I'll give you more this time but next time you come here you'll know better'.  We were pretty taken aback by this brazen hussy.  Obviously avocados are expensive which is why you charge extra on your menu for them!  Hopefully if you choose to go t",2,Negative

1494,Elephant & Castle,"I had their stuffed Yorkshire pudding and my friend had their fish and chips. The orders were huge and somewhat delicious. Surprisingly the mashed potato was really good. I was a little disappointed with the fish though. The fish 'chunks' are embarrassingly small but it was served with a lot of thick long fries. It seemed to me that they are cutting back on the cod/halibut and hope that the potatoes will fill the gap. Real British chips are thick and 'chipped', not long. The interior looks authentic but the atmosphere is no where near the pubs that I have been in England. Service is not bad. Disappointedly, they don't sell Britain's best selling Carling beer.",3,Negative
1495,Elephant & Castle,"I've been in here a couple times...First off they have a Good Selection of beers, and I'm not talking about bud, bud light miller or any other swill. They have GOOD beers ie: Guinness,Harp, Fullers, Smithwicks ect...  The Atmosphere is nice it really does resemble an old English pub. The food however is better than most English pubs or at least the ones I've been too.  They have a lot of traditional English fair such as Bangers and Mash, Shepard's pie, bread pudding (which is absolutely amazing!!!!) and also burgers and chicken fingers (beer battered) All in all, a great little Pub.....Bang On!",5,Positive
1496,Elephant & Castle,"Please read Mike M.'s review below (2005)   This bar is located in the heart of the financial district which is why so many business people are here.  Weekdays if you are just getting off work and want to relax in a nicely decorated pub, drink an expensive beer, do come.  Food is excellent, moderately priced for the area. Alcohol is expensive, beers average $6-8 bucks, no 23ozs. Surprisingly shots weren't as expensive as I thought, $6-7 bucks, large shotglass. Bartenders were cluless about different shots I'd ordered, even when I'd given them the solutions, they still managed to screw it up. Waitstaff and bartenders are helpful and the atmosphere is fun.

1499,Elephant & Castle,"We had lunch there - seemed really slow for lunch time on a weekday.  I ordered the large Chopped Chicken salad which was standard. the Honey mustard dressing was a little creamy to my taste. My friend ordered the Mahi sandwich which was good but the plate was covered in the sauce from his cole slaw.  The side caesar was chinsy for $6 - iceberg, parmesan and dressing.   Service was hit or miss.

I have had the fish and chips as well as the Shepherd's Pie (which, if you ask a Brit or so I've heard, is actually 'Cottage Pie') and both have been good and reasonably priced. Last night we went with friends at 9pm on a Thursday (wanting a relatively inexpensive place) and E&C was packed and albeit a bit loud with some overserved yuppies, but we were seated immediately.

1506,Elephant & Castle,"With a name like Elephant & Castle, I probably would not be too eager to go for drinks in a bar with such a name, but every time I walked by it was super crowded. At last, I finally went for an after work drink, and they had a good special on Tuesday.....$3 Honeyweiss. I definitely recommend the Chicken Picks (deep fried pieces of chicken), Pretzels (again, deep fried), and the Potato Wedges (boiled? nope, deep fried). They were all mighty tasty though! The service was excellent, and we had a seat right next to the window to watch all the people freezing their butts off in the cold, while we were nice and toasty with our drinks and assortments of fried goodies.",4,Positive

1510,Eleven City Diner,"The overall 3 1/2 stars rating for this place is fairly accurate. A lot of people have seemed to get hung up on the cost, but you're in the loop, and you're not really at a hole in the wall diner, so if you didn't know what you were getting into price wise, the jury is out on whose fault that is. The food is good. I've only had one thing (Mexican scramble) but it is delicious. Request your potatoes well done. My issue with this place is mostly how it's run. Extra salsa on the side for my eggs? Surcharge, which is absurd. And everyone who has called the staff rude I'll vouch for. Most of which probably trickles down from the owner. I know a lot of restaurants say they don't take bloggers and yelp seriously but enough people on this site have posted that they think the servers are rude, and ",3,Negative
1511,Eleven City Diner,"I like the food at Eleven City and don't mind paying a little extra, I don't think I've been able to finish a meal yet, because of the huge portions. I loved the Reuben and the french toast is probably the best I've had that wasn't made by my Dad as a kid. As far as the spotty service goes, of the three times I've been there so far, the service was pretty bad 2 out of 3 times with the most recent being the best service so I don't think it'll keep me from coming back.",4,Positive
1512,Eleven City Diner,"Our service was prompt, our waitress was nice, and the food (I had pancakes with fresh berries and whipped cream, with a side of potatoes) was yummy and filling. And yet, that has absolutely NOTHING to do with my rating. They have Vernors. *turns away to discreetly wipe a tear* Vernors! You have to understand that I am from Michigan and Vernors was the only ginger ale we ever bought and the best cure for whenever I felt a little sick to the tummy. But getting Vernors in Chicago is no easy feat. And that damn Canada Dry stuff doesn't make me smile like my home state staple. So yes, my entire rating is based off the availability of one of my favorite beverages. And none of you will judge me for it!",4,Positive
1513,Eleven City Diner,"There may be a wait everywhere else but you never wait more than 10 minutes at Eleven City Diner.

Waiters are pretty entertaining bunch too.",5,Positive

The menu is huge, but it's kind of all the same, and nothing on it is particularly interesting or special. Don't get me wrong--the portions are good, and it's all pretty standard breakfast and diner fare that tastes just about what you'd expect. The atmosphere is nice--it's clean and kind of old-timey, and the service is just fine. It's a fine place to grab a sandwich or some pancakes and eggs. It won't blow you away, but it's ok.

First off, the food is very expensive for what it is.  Its a glorified diner - which means that lunch for two shouldn't be $65.  Way too pricey.  Service is mediocrity at its finest.  One may think to blame the wait staff for this, but alas, its really not their fault.  Look who they have to deal with on a daily basis.  Keep reading... The owner/manager, Brad Rubin, is a real character.  And by 'character', I mean 'prick.' He treats his employees like dog shit on his shoe.  That attitude translates to his patrons.

Less than cordial waiters, crappy food, and huge prices. I've gone with three other people who all agree. Too expensive for food that really isn't good. Not to mention, the last time I went there with my boyfriend, they charged him $1.75 for what is equal to a cup of milk (if you're using a measuring cup) and the waitress told us refills aren't free. Are you kidding me with this? Not even a full glass of milk cost $1.75 and no refills. If I had a kid and took them there, that would be about the appropriate size for a kid's milk, but not  for an adult. Their food is bland and boring and costs way more than it should.

I personally love the milkshakes, patty melt, red velvet cake, and matzo ball soup.. These are some must-haves! There was only one gripe I had.

I've noticed that a few people misinterpreted this as attitude...it is not... it is personality and comes with great food. The corned beef is a tasty standard, I'm a fan of the corned beef-pastrami hash (however, it doesnt work for those dieting); the lox platter is a favorite. Tried everything from omelets to burgers and all has been close to perfect. (i am quite picky and have high standards with my food as my other reviews show).

The roast beef is top notch, although I'm not a huge fan of the turkey. I live for the patty melt, cooked a perfect medium rare and doused in thousand island and topped with caramelized onions.

She had been there before and kept telling us it isn't like any other diner, and boy was she right. This place was simply amazing, especially for a bunch of Jews. Although this place isn't kosher, it has tons of Judaica stuff all over the place. They have He'brew beer displayed everywhere and also sell Heeb magazine. We showed up and there was a bit of a wait, but I will definitely not let this hurt the review.

1545,Eleven City Diner,"So Good!! As a member of the tribe myself, I am always excited to check out various Jewish Delis/Diners in the Chicago area.  This one really blew me away. As I awaited my table, I was literally drooling over the dishes I saw around me.  When we finally sat down (about a 25 minute wait for mid-day on a Saturday, not terrible for the area) I decided on the roasted vegetable sandwich, sub cheese fries for the salad, because really, they just sounded right. Sandwich came out on this delish foccacia bread and had pesto sauce spread on it.  My only complaint was the too-think slice of roasted onion on the sandwich - it was just a bit much for my taste.  Much to my suprise, and delight, the cheese fries were cheddar cheese fries!  So tasty, gooey, and heart-cloggingly excellent.

I topped it off with a Brooklyn egg cream which was also great. While the sandwiches were great, I didn't think there was anything awsome about the fries (they were very good).  My wife and I also tried the desert a few nights later and didn't find anything about the chocolate or carrot cakes to write home about. At some point I'd like to come back and try their breakfast foods. The lines seem long for most of the day.  We got there at 2pm on a Saturday and had to wait 30 minutes.  On the other hand, we came back a few days later at 8pm for desert and were seated immediately.

The last time we went, they were making fresh kreplach from scratch, so the Ju Pu Platter (which I ordered), took a bit longer than everyone else's food.  I couldn't have cared less, I was enjoying the company I was with and was in no hurry, and since they said it was taking longer because they were making fresh kreplach, I was happy with that.  But then they even gave me a bowl of homemade chicken noodle ",4,Positive

The diner has been there about four years, although I have to admit I'd not heard of it before.  They set it up to look like a New York Deli, sort of like the Carnegie Deli, although it is much more spacious.  In fact, they compare themselves to the Carnegie. When we arrived, my wife mentioned we were there to celebrate Rosh Hashana.  The waiter immediately took us to a reserved table with white linens on it.   They had several of these set up around the place just for that",5,Positive

This place had a good vibe and the food was good. A nice mix between a higher-end diner and Jewish comfort food.  Sandwiches were huge, the matzo ball soup, if you are a connoisseur of such fare, was typical restaurant broth plus massive ball; this is not your bubby's soup - but i've never been to a restaurant that makes it like she can anyway.

Had a little bit of breakfast and a little bit of lunch for our dinner last time, plus a chocolate shake to top it off. The chocolate malt was the best I've had in the city, no joke. It's refreshing to have something that doesn't come out of machine once in a while. Mac N Cheese (with ham) is the bomb. The challah bread (pronounced 'Holla!' by our entertaining server) was the perfect side to the scramble we had as well.

Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but I just don't dig the vibe in here.  It is a little pretentious in a very subtle, somewhat off putting way.  Can't put my finger on it.  However, this place does come very highly regarded and it is loved by many.  Part of me wishes I would have loved it more.",3,Positive

1602,Eleven City Diner,"Well, Seeing that I've written my thoughts on two other breakfast restaurants, I figured I should share my opinions on this one as well. All in all I like it. I love the atmosphere. Walking into the diner you feel like your in an actual dinner out of the 30s or 40s. Everything is new and clean. It doesn't have the feeling of being in some really old place that has been left unchanged. It feels more like going back in time, the design is very well done. The food isn't too bad. Its not wonderful, and they don't have eggs benedict (My favorite) . However they do have a few fancy and unique options that might be delicious, but Ive only been there a couple of times and I am yet to try them. My one complaint (besides the eggs benedict thing) would be that the service has never been that friendly",4,Negative
1603,Eleven City Diner,"Tiny, charming, Americana-diner in the heart of South loop. A lot of the menu here is Jewish-style - probably a typical menu you would find at a typical New York Jewish diner, like Katz.  Eleven City has the similar flair as the Katz in New York, but the actual food isn't.  Anyone nostalgic to the New York scene would love it here. I tried the Reuben sandwich during the lunch hour at a bar seating.  The food was delicious, but it could have used a bit thicker rye bread.  The atmosphere is very casual and relaxed; the waiting staff lets the customers take their time.  I've seen several customers reading books or newspapers while they ate. This is about the only 'decent' diner in the entire Loop area.  If anyone knows of any other, please suggest...",4,Positive
1604,Eleven City Diner,"Finding a good Jewish-style deli in the city is harder than one would expect.  This place certainly satisfied my craving for one, and I will be back from time to time.  I had the Hoppel Poppel and Matzo Ball soup.  I have had better Hoppel Poppel (at Chicago Bagel and Deli in Buffalo Grove) and better Matzo Ball Soup (at The Buffalo Restaurant in Buffalo Grove) but on balance it is quite good and worth a repeat visit.  I can't wait to try the Pastrami Hash.",4,Positive

Its kitschy Jewish grandma feel pretty much works for someone like me who is searching for a deli/home fashioned meal type joint with reasonable prices. The service is mixed, I've encountered young ladies to be divine waitress' while had an old disgruntled male who was far from what I wanted in a server. it's a toss up but I suggest sitting at the bar if you can bare the cramped space. the french toast is where its at. problems with eleven city: no deal on a dozen bagels. they charge over a dollar per bagel, which is absurd. really.",4,Negative

1610,Eleven City Diner,"I want to like eleven. I really do. But it's overpriced. The food isn't very good. The two times I ordered breakfast, my toast was burnt both times. Once I ordered an omelet and when it arrived, it was sitting in a pool of butter. It was completely inedible because it was so saturated with butter. And don't get me wrong, I love me some butter. But holy crap, I'm convinced they were trying to kill me, send me into cardiac arrest, something. When the waitress came back to check on us, I politely mentioned the grand canyon of butter and instead of taking it away she laughed it off.  'Ha, there's nothing wrong with a little butter.' And then she walked away. So I wrung out my omelet, gnawed on my burnt toast, paid the expensive bill, and vowed to never return. Show owner comment »",2,Negative

This time my biggest gripe was that after we finally sat and got our food, they kept trying to take empty plates and glasses that clearly had hunks of food on them. I ordered a bloody mary and they took that away before I finished the drink or even the olives! Our server was really nice and although we came as an incomplete party, we had to figure out to sit at the bar otherwise we would've waited for our party in the lobby.

Eleven City was rated much higher than the other local eatery I could see from where I was standing, but...a diner? Hmmm.... I made the right decision!

I love the old diner feel... it is a little loud, very lively and has a good lunch crowd. We sat down at the booth and perused the menu, which has EVERYTHING. Breakfast all day? Yes. Please pass the pancakes! I had their Cobb Salad, and it wasn't too bad. The ingredients were very fresh, and I always appreciate large chunks of blue cheese. My work peeps had the burgers and a tuna melt. Food was great overall. My only complaint was that the service was super slow. But I guess that can be expected in a busy diner! I will definitely be back to try their monster chocolate malt shake!",4,Positive

While the portion sizes are somewhat large, the food doesn't feel worth the $30 two people might drop there. The tuna melt I ordered was drenched in cheddar cheese, but otherwise not too terrible. I enjoyed my everything bagel I opted for upon my second visit. The food here is just OK, nothing more, nothing less.",3,Negative
1618,Eleven City Diner,"Stick to the deli type foods when visiting this place. Don't order any of their dinner meals. The primavera pasta was beyond lame, the white wine sauce was melted oil.

From day 1 the owner of this place has been a prick.  Not so much to the customers, but his employees.  He will give them a hard time - yelling at them or mocking them in front of customers.  He walks around like he's hot shit, when he owns a shitty diner in the South Loop.   As for the food.  Boring.  Bland.  Burgers are premade patties, most likely bought in bulk at Costco.   The only reason this place is still open is because not enough new places have opened.  Give it time and before long Eleven City will be gone.",1,Negative

However there is one thing that I don't appreciate, that is the rudeness of one owners.  He is definitely sarcastic.  I understand that he's truly busy on Saturday's.  But you don't have to be mean to customers.  This is totally unacceptable.  I say if he get's rude with you just walk up the street to Yolk.

I recommend the french toast as well as the Tom Waits (a huge portion of pancakes, eggs, sausage and toast) if you don't mind sharing with a your companion. The bloody mary's are also very good. The only drawback to this place is the overbearing owner and the cadre of cute but incompetent hostesses that work here. This usually comes to play on a weekend in the summer. You may end up waiting 20 minutes while open tables are available - very weird system that they have about seating people.

Nothing says 'cheapskates' like a $4.50 Schlitz. Except maybe $6.75 for Bell's Amber (really, you need that extra quarter for your laundry?), or apple pie a la mode for $7.15. Surprisingly unbohemian prices, considering it's next door to a Columbia College facility. To be fair, my food was fairly decent.

Oh yeah, on weekends, expect a wait, but good luck finding a brunch spot in the SL w/o one. Moving onto the positives, the sandwiches are huge, if you're into that. If you're not, take the other half home and you have dinner or, at least, a snack. My personal favorite is the french toast with the bananas and strawberries on challah bread.

1655,Eleven City Diner,"Just realized that I never reviewed one of my favorite restaurants. Today there was a Bear's game and the place was packed. Even though we were told there would be a 30 minute wait, it was probably only 10. We sat at the 'breakfast bar' which is actually more comfortable than the bar b/c the seats are lower. Folks, I wasn't hungry so I only had an English muffin and an OJ. I love their fresh squeezed OJ! My menu favorites include French toast, pancakes, and their turkey burger. It's got a nice punch to it and goes down easy w/a Fat Tire beer. My only complaint w/11 City is the volume of the music. Way too loud. Servers all seem very happy working there. The place has a nice vibe.",4,Positive

When you visit, get anything with corned beef, pastrami, or their rye bread; you cant go wrong.  Our last trip we got the deli scramble; scrambled eggs with corned beef and pastrami it was fantastic.  Get yourself a reuben your first time, you will become a maniac about Eleven City like me after one.  Their meats are absolutely tastebud melting.

1705,Eleven City Diner,"This place is a breath of fresh air and just a whole lot of fun.  The BF and I came here for a late lunch on a Saturday.  A couple of conventions were in town, so the place was packed.  But the host assured us that the line was moving fast.  It did move pretty fast, but whatever wait we did have, it was worth it.  The host suggested bloody marys while we waited, and we both agreed enthusiastically.  As promised, we were seated within fifteen minutes in a cool booth across for the bar.  The oldies were playing, and the decor reminded me of a funkified soda fountain. I ordered the latke lox plate, which consisted of a huge latke topped with cream cheese, tomato, hand-cut lox (either nova or regular), onions,  and capers.  The BF had the lox plate, which was everything I had but a bagel inste",4,Positive
1706,Eleven City Diner,"I almost moved into the neighborhood just because of this place. Jewtopia! It was the closest to true New York Jewish style deli that I've been to outside of NY.

The 3 managers keep whispering back and forth,  very put upon and made me feel terrible and finally put me in a single table in the deli aginst a wall. I was very hungry so I took this table and let them know that the Amercians With Disabilities Act requires establishments to accomodate individuals who are impaired as I am.

1714,Emerald Loop,"This place was super happening from the outside. Packed to the brim!  There were so many people I could barely move and it was a huge pain to get a drink at the bar. We showed up right around 6pm on a Friday night which would explain the abundance of people and despite my annoyance in the beginning, it was still a pretty fun bar. We stayed there for a few hours as well and it definitely cleared out once the happy hour rush left to pursue other Friday evening endeavors. The drinks were also a bit pricey I think but is to be expected at a bar right in the downtown loop area. While I didn't eat any food when here, I happened to see more than a few tantalizing dishes pass my way while enjoying my beverage.

1716,Emerald Loop,"This place is a near clone of that other quasi-British Isles pub, Elephant and Castle; they should just combine these two places and call it Elephant Loop, you know, kind of like those mediocre bands of the 70s: Kansas-Foreigner-Boston that all sound the same. I went here with zero expectations. I wasn't disappointed or wowed; it was exactly as I expected - a menu that's kind of all over the place, a bunch of beers on tap, and swift service. Nothing on the menu thrilled me so I ordered a relatively safe dish: the southwest chicken salad, which now appears on every menu from Cheesecake Factory to McDonald's. The salad was okay, The greens were fresh, and there wasn't an abundance of dressing, which is ok by me. My only complaint is that the chicken was ice-cold, like it was sitting in the c",3,Positive

Let me start by saying the service was great.  Delightful server, very prompt, perfect attention level.  She even split the checks with a smile, which is a royal pain. The food, however, didn't impress.  Menu had variety, but it was a pub so fish and chips was the obvious choice for me.  Wish I hadn't.  The portion size was enormous (that's a good thing) but after a bite or two that didn't matter as much.  It's not that it tasted BAD, it's more like it didn't taste like much of anything.  Blah, no flavor, didn't excite me in any way.  Others said similar things, it was decidedly so-so I guess. I'd give it 2.5 stars",2,Negative

I went here recently after work with co-workers and friends and enjoyed a cold Guinness 250 in the popular, yet roomy bar area.

It's conveniently located, not far from the Clark & Lake Blue line stop downtown. I loved the dark-wood decor, but I would have loved it better if the vibe was a bit more homey. It was pretty crowded towards the front & bar area. I felt more tables and stool seating would have been in order. Service was decent - plates taken away; waitress noticing my arrival after I came back from the bathroom; and everything arriving promptly. I ate one piece of cheese pizza along with one chip & dip in the guacamole. I drank the 'weed & ?' cocktail ($8.50) -- a mix of lemonade & sweet tea liquor. All of that got the 'niiiiiice",3,Positive

Not just another sandwich but more like a super stacker.  There were 3 layers of bread and meat in between and cut into half.  We ordered the chicken wrap, blackened sandwich and grilled burger.

The best thing I had was the BBQ wings they were quite tasty. If I go back it will be for the wings and beer. The onion rings and fries were too greasy even though they had potential.

The concierge recommended emerald loop and even though we were slightly turned away from the fact that it was an Irish pub, we decided to give it a try and were impressed. The chicken and arugula salad was fantastic with it's raspberry dressing and the shepards pie was good, not as tasty as I like and had to add more salt and pepper. The rest of the menu looked great though, there was something for everyone. Overall I would definately go there again. We were able to enjoy people watching in a busy part of town with scrumptious food.",5,Positive
1727,Emerald Loop,"I had been to Emerald a couple of times and thought it was a typical, mediocre downtown bar that would be universally loved (as all Irish bars are). I was surprised, however, at the blatant racism of the bartender on the Sunday before Memorial Day. Basically, the bartender does not like to serve black folks. This is easily noticed by his lack of conversation when black customers order and in his inability to get drinks to them when ordered. For example, my mate ordered a shot of SoCo and lime. It never came. So my mate went to the bar and was told, I'm out of lime juice. This, of course, makes sense. What doesn't make sense is he did not offer an alternative - like SoCo sans lime or something else? And frankly, how can a bar be out of lime juice!

I am not sure.. But it is not oily, it is crunchy, it is fresh and a nice chunky piece of cod. It comes with perfectly cooked peas.. Absolutely perfectly cooked....

I was craving wings, and got plump, golden Teriyaki wings for $10, along with a Sierra Nevada (they have a beer special every month) for $4.  My bf got the chicken marsala for $13, piled high with chicken, carmelized onions, and fried gnocci with savory sauce.   The good service, and college football playing on 5 screens were an added bonus.  It might become a weekend favorite - I need to check out their hot and curry wings first.",4,Positive

Waitresses made sure were attended to, but we didn't want food as we had just come from the Taste. We just wanted drinks before we headed to the AMC. I went the Ralph C route and got a pear flavored Magners cider. it was ok, I guess...LOL! Like last time it took a little while for the drinks to come out.

The first time, my company hosted a happy hour in the semi-private area that is a few steps up from the rest of the bar.

We had a couple of fruit & cheese trays, chicken fingers, goat cheese quesadillas, and a few other things that I can't recall. I wasn't really all that excited by the food, but rather the free open bar on my company's tab. The staff was friendly, the drinks strong and the tab not nearly as much as expected.

Was seated promptly and the service was very attentive and nice.  Love the atmosphere inside, felt like your standard pub, but less douchey than Wrigleyville.  (Yes, I'm getting old.) Prices were decent for a bar in the loop.  The nachos were pretty damn good, but nothing haute cuisine, just a big ass plate of nachos with chicken or beef, jalapenos, and other stuff.  I was surprised to find peas in the mix, which I loved.  FYI, the cheese isn't liquidy, aka it dries and clumps the chips together, but pretty standard for bar nachos.

So, we were immediately seated at a table. I ordered the goat cheese quesadillas and she ordered a sandwich. I thought that the quesadillas were excellent! So much goat cheese and delicious.

Those ones just slap an Irish name on and hang a Guinness poster on the way to the mens' room. The rest quickly devolve into Johnny O'Tooligans Irish Drinking Emporium where the decor certainly says all the right things, but the soul is lacking. Emerald Loop is more of the latter. The decor is certainly nice, but I would see this place as more of a lunch spot instead of a happy hour or dinner spot. The place got loud surprisingly quickly.

While I didn't eat here- my friends did and they said their sandwiches were okay.  The menu has a range of Irish and American favorites.   From my viewpoint- the beer was cold and there's a nice choice on tap.  They do a strong pour of Whiskey and the bartenders kept an eye out for any empty glasses that might need refilling. All okay in my book. Interesting mix of people, from professionals, to ball 'leaguers' to people coming from the nearby theater district.   While it may not be a regular hang out for me- it's just good to know that there is another choice in this part of the Loop.",3,Positive

The music was DJ style and it was a good mix.  Some Mumford and Sons, some Beatles, with a dash of Kelly Clarkson thrown in there.  Something for everyone! The bathrooms are really clean, too.  A definite plus in the city, because that's not always the case! I perused a menu",4,Positive

I doubt there is ever a time where it's too crowded for comfort because it's so big. I'll be back for more. I was actually pleasantly surprised after we decided to come here for lunch. I think it is a decent choice for a sit-down meal. I ordered the turkey entree plate, with slices of roasted turkey, a side of mashed potatoes with gravy, and steamed vegetables. The veggies clearly are of the frozen variety, but that's ok. The turkey was moist, juicy, and well-seasoned. The mashed potatoes hit the spot that day. It was the perfect plate for a chilly November day. One small gripe, the menu said there was cranberry sauce, but it didn't come with any. When I asked the server, ",3,Positive

We walked up and down Wacker trying to find a restaurant without a reservation. Finally we came to Emil's and I was surprised it wasn't more crowded. We were able to sit in the bar, which was misleading because there were a handful of tables and booths in the 'bar' section. The service was very good and the specials that night were all appetizing. I settled on a shrimp and asparagus risotto (if you read my reviews you will notice my love of risotto) :) My coworker had lamb. Both meals were very tasty and the presentation was beautiful.

I was there on a Monday and it was free. The selection was vegetables, dip and a chicken fajita pizza.  Interesting combinations. The lunch menu is decent and their soups are a perfect comfort food.   The portions can be a bit much, but it's still a good deal for a loop restaurant.",3,Positive

That said, I've only ever been here for lunch, so I can't really vouch for happy hour or dinner or any of that. A vendor has bought lunch for a few of us at work here twice and both times I had a perfectly pleasant experience. It's not mind-blowingly awesome, but certainly tasty and the service was fine both times. The other advantage it has over some of the other financial district eateries is that it's not as LOUD during lunch. Lloyds, by comparison, is so loud you have to yell to make yourself heard to whomever you're eating with. Perfectly satisfactory.",3,Positive

The chips were REALLY oily on that trip, but I have had them other times and they were less oily (maybe a bad batch?)

The rather oddly redecorated space (think 1969 American 'French Provincial' meets Studio 54) is a little more swank than your average Loop watering hole, yet still friendly (it's not a club with a VIP section or anything), and they do have 'real' tables (booths, banquettes) rather than the usual wobbly tall, tiny bar table things, but is priced accordingly.  Also, because they're technically a 'hotel bar', tax is not",3,Positive

Today I had the veggie sandwich melt with grilled eggplant, peppers, onions, carrots, and lettuce -- it was very good. Size of the crowd varies for lunch. I've been in Encore when I've had to eat at the bar. I prefer a table and was seated at one today. Tables are small except for a couple of large booths that are tough to snag.

If you sit at the circular bar you might be lucky enough to be waited on by Lucy who pours a great martini and can suggest cocktails to satisfy even the pickiest in your group.  She also knows all the 'regulars' and takes a minute to talk to everyone (the sign of a good bartender in my book) ,4,Positive

New lunch place for me, new marital status for him. Newness all around. I walked in and two things struck me: we were able to be seated immediately at noon, which if you work downtown, you know is no small feat, and bonus: they were playing great 70s oldies.

Oh man, the peanut butter shake is a national treasure. (You can get all shakes and smoothies with soymilk, yogurt, and low-fat milk. For some reason no soy ice cream to go with the soymilk, much to the sadness of my lactose intolerant father-in-law). The fries are also delicious and remind me of boardwalk fries.

Some have complained about the lack of menu options.  Personally, I like that they stick to what they know and don't put a ton of salads in the fridge case or try to sell things they are not good at.  Simply menu is the way to go. A little on the pricey side for lunch, but definitely worth it if you enjoy a good burger that was grass fed and treated humanely.  Some have mentioned that they should be paying less because it is a ",5,Negative

Given that this place carves out a unique niche in the fast food scene, with its turkey burger and cage-free egg topping (declined), I'm not sure why I'm not more excited about the place.  Maybe it's in part that for all its assembly-line efficiency, it doesn't (yet?) attract the eclectic and often rascally mix of coupon-clippi",3,Positive

There's not much selection.  As far as burgers, you can either get the regular (comes with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, raw or grilled onions; fried egg, organic bacon, and choice of cheese are about $0.70 extra) or the BLT (which comes with the egg, bacon, and cheese already!) - both for $5.99.  They have 1 chicken sandwich option, 1 turkey burger option, and 1 portabello mushroom sandwich option.  That's about the entire menu.  They also offer combo meals (burg",3,Negative

Rather than the dictionary meaning, I can still see the vinyl spinning round in those bluish-purple colors on the living room stereo beneath the 70's hanging globed light. As a kid, it was a close as I could get to a mirrored disco-ball. Epic, of course, meant 'Epic Records' home of the former Jackson 5 singer whose name I shared. Dancing at home on Friday nights, I pretended to be living 'Off the Wall' & wondered what it would feel like 'Working Day and Night'...ooh Lawd.

Um, like $20 - what in the fuck just happened? And this is not like a gastropub with 'ambiance' or anything. It would be much less painful if the service was a lot, lot better.

They've also got bacon and a fried egg as options, if you feel as though your heart is strong enough to handle the  extra ingredients.

They are about as close to being organic and sustainable as is possible and I applaud them for it. All in all, I am a BIG fan!

Upon opening the box, the turkey patty had the appearance of a smashed 'Wendy's' patty. Yes, it was square but very flat. Regardless of its appearance and removed toppings ... it was tasty. The fries on the other hand, were not good at all (bad night?)  If your liking includes burnt 1/4 length fries with too much sea salt...then go for it! I'm more of a DIY turkey burger girl.  All of my ingredients top out to less than $9.89 (which was the total for my order from here).   With that said, it was a decent change (with the exception of the fries) from the norm and worth another visit (but not anytime soon).",3,Positive

I ordered the epic burger combo with a four berry smoothie, and I was waiting to experience the epicness. Unfortunately, the burger was a little dry for my taste, and I had to add a lot more ketchup than a good burger should require. The sauce wasn't extraordinary, but did remind me of the goodness that is In-n-Out back home. That also reminded me that I could've gotten the same amount of food there for half the price.

I ended up ordering the turkey burger on wheat with all the toppings and fries. Not going to lie but that turkey burger was ammmazzing! It was juicy, flavorful, not too salty, and that bun! Their wheat bun is perfect! Not too heavy and has a slight sweetness to it. The fries were good too and they have malt vinegar too! Sorry not really a fan of ketchup!

I had the epic burger (beef) on a wheat roll with havarti horseradish, lettuce, tomato, pickles and epic sauce. I chowed down on the burger with the hand cut fries with sea salt. The burger was moist and packed full. I really liked the wheat roll as a 'healthy' alternative. I thought that there was something missing (flavor wise) from the burger. It was good but not epic.

I asked the 2 cool brothers behind the counter what would they recommend and they told me 'the Epic Burger combo'. They also told me I could add toppings such as a fried egg and bacon. I definitely added the bacon & eggs along with cheddar cheese (other options were blue cheese and something else). I also had the option of wheat and white bread...I chose wheat. The combo came with fries and a drink which came out to $12. The burger itself was pretty good, but because I had everything you ",4,Negative
1880,Epic Burger,"Had to try a place that calls itself 'epic burger'. I also wanted something good and different for lunch today so I'd thought I would give epic a try.  After all they have some pretty good reviews.  They have the all natural thing going so i've been on the natural kick lately and wanted to try it.  I got the epic burger combo on a wheatbun +1 star. Natural hand cut fries +1 star.  Quick service, guess what, +1 star.   Nice overall.  Burger was juicy, added some bacon just cause I can (everything is better with bacon).  I'm not sure about epic's special sauce, it's kinda blah.   I'll forgo it next time.  And yes there will be a next time.  Its close to work and has good food...

1881,Epic Burger,"Whenever I get a burger craving, I like to hop on the red line to Epic Burger because the burgers are consistently yummy.  The patties have crisped edges, and they also toast the buns.  Toppings are pretty simple: lettuce, tomato, onions (grilled or raw), pickles, and special sauce.  Just a great tasting no-fuss burger with the right amount of toppings that don't overwhelm the meaty taste.  Extra add-ons are bacon, fried egg, and cheese (havarti, cheddar, blue).   Also, they use biodegradable cups and utensils!",4,Positive

Getting the trivialities out of the way first: The space is pretty nice. Clean, modern, warm. Like an upscale fast food place. Which is what Epic Burger is. They built the place expecting long lines. You can basically have a line from the front door to the counter (way in back, and it's a deep space) without interfering with anything or annoying the patrons dining in the restaurant. Unfortunately you can't see the menu until you get up near the counter, so you can't use your time waiting in line (I went in a bit early and didn't have to wait) to study the menu and decide what you want.

1883,Epic Burger,I had been hearing a lot about this place so I stopped on down after work for a bite to eat. I got in at about 9:30 (closes at 10) and decided to get my food to go because I work at a restaurant and I hate when people come in right before close and sit down. As I approached the register one of the employees sauntered over from the back of the restaurant. Her heals were dragging so loudly that I giggled to myself. I asked if I could get food to go and after a barley audible 'uh huh' i ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She informed me that they were out of bacon (what?!) and it could only be a cheeseburger. I said ok and asked for mayo and then she told me I could only get it in packets. I obliged and as I took my number I watched the kitchen.

I played it safe and ordered a burger with cheddar cheese.  I plan on getting the horseradish Havarti cheese next time, maybe even throw a fried egg on the top.  These unique toppings are part of what makes Epic Burger so epic. The fries resembled In N Out's (My benchmark for all burger joints) and had the perfect amount of salt and the fresh taste of potato present.  I am happy to have a south loop burger haven that I can now escape to!",4,Positive

I'm still not sure if the burger really warranted the 'epic' moniker, but it was a tasty, fresh melange of texture and flavor.  Loved that I could hook up the havarti cheese, and the hand-cut fries were hot and crispy.  I also enjoyed a cool cup of fountain root beer with my meal. I really wanted to get the fried egg on top, but decided to stave off a heart attack for one night. Overall, it's a tad on the pricey side, but I suppose I've come to expect that from Chicago burger place.  In addition, the local/fresh thing leads to expectations of quality, and an associated price point.  Epic Burger has the green thing down to a T--they even have biodegradable utens",4,Positive

I have to admit, for a 'fast-food' joint, it was darn G-O-O-D.  Granted, half way through my burger, I had the special sauce on my suit and an empty bun from where all the meat used to be.  But, I can't complain; it just meant that somehow I was eating so fast that I lost sight of the burger/bun ratio.  The fries were decent, although I do like Patty's fries better.   The food gets 5 stars, but the girl at the counter was rude to me even though I was the only one in line and she took forever to even acknowledge me(hmmm...) so the one star is dropped for that.",4,Negative

I got an Epic Burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and Epic sauce. The patty had a loose construction and was not too thick, not too thin, and cooked all the way through - something that I personally like.  Ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard rounded it out and made for a really tasty combo. The downside was that it was so juicy & saucy that I opted to eat it with a knife and fork, which was kind of a pain (but saved me from dripping down my arm and/or onto my shirt). The fries were good, natural-cut, but on the very, very done side. Despite all the browning, they tended more toward soggy than crispy.",3,Negative

Epic Burger has obviously found it's niche -- most likely people in the loop who want to feel good about eating red meat and who probably shop at Whole Foods because Trader Joes isn't classy enough --  and I'm happy for them. When I got my burger and fries, they were cold. The cheese I had asked for on it wasn't on it and my shake was too thin.   I really wanted this place to be good, because at least once a month while working in the loop I really want some red meat and to be honest, the concept of this place DOES make me feel like it's ok to eat red meat once a month.

There are enough reviews so I'll stick to why the food will bring me back.  The burger was so juicy it dripped a bit as I ate it.  Just a bit crisp on the outside, thoroughly cooked inside and very substantial without being excessive.  It was juicy but not greasy.  Still, I can't imagine ordering a double.  The trimmings are what you'd expect.  I got a fried egg on mine which was perfectly cooked and gave a nice added flavor and texture, especially with the yolk just runny enough to enjoy but not enough to drip out.  A large toothpick was also a nice touch to keep the insides from sliding out the back as ",4,Positive
1894,Epic Burger,"Epic Burger was, indeed, epic. I went with a couple of coworkers who recommended it. I'm going to suggest it next time I'm in a burger mood. Burgers come with lettuce, tomato, pickle, grilled or raw onions, and their special sauce, which seems to be a seasoned mayo. I generally dislike mayo on my sandwiches and burgers, but it actually works really well with the fries. I got the turkey burger on a wheat bun to convince myself that this was healthy. The patty was well-seasoned and I liked the toasted buns. Our food came out relatively quickly. In my opinion, the $5.99 price tag is pretty reasonable for a burger. I mean, the product is obviously better than McD's, and if you go to a sit down restaurant for a burger, it will run you more than that. It is really hard to find a solid lunch for ",4,Positive

I expect flavors other than I can get at any random diner in Chicago.

I got the Epic Burger with cheddar, lettuce, and tomato with fries.  The burger was large, juicy, greasy, and delicious (however it was a bit too peppery for my ideal).  The fries reminded me of the ones from Great Steak & Potato Co (I mean that as a compliment) with the skins on, a little crispy but mostly soft, and all stuck together.  I also had a few sips (or half of) my boyfriend's",3,Positive

We were trying to go to Panera Bread, but seeing as we had never been to Epic Burger and it seemed delicious (fried egg always has my vote) we stood in line. We were intrigued by the fact that almost everything was organic...the beef is farm raised cattle, the cheese is aged in Wisconsin, the bacon is nitrite free...even the cups and straws are made from plants!

I did not know that about myself, so I guess that is something I will work in evaluating for my own self improvement.

The combination of burger meat with a fried egg is like happy marriage and for those who want to opt out of all that cholesterol, Epic Burger gives you choices as to what you want on your burger ranging from mushrooms to onions and the usual lettuce and tomato. The bun is the best part of the burger, lightly toasted and you even get a choice between wheat, sourdough and regular. The burger itself isn't monstrous, not really living up to it's 'epic' name but I actually prefer it that way because it's easier to pick up and you don't have any soggy leftovers.

The kind of really disappointing fries. They were really hot when we got them, and then they quickly cooled off into a soggy mess.  The taste was something to be desired as well.  We got two orders, but when the fries arrived, we could have easily shared one order.

The menu is pretty simple, they don't overwhelm you with tons of choices and crazy combinations.  I stayed pretty traditional and got the epic burger on wheat, no onions with aged cheddar.  I'm not a big condiments person so I, unlike my husband, don't douse everything in ketchup and ranch dressing.  The epic sauce was good when I could taste it but a little bit of a kick would have been awesome.   As someone else said below, the patty IS flatty, with a name like Epic I would have expected",4,Positive

It was ok - first I'll qualify this by saying that I'm not a big 'thin' burger fan. If I wanted that, I could end up getting it for a whole lot cheaper at a place like Culvers (2 Burgers + Extra Toppings + Fries + 1 Drink = $26 at Epic).

I'm not exactly sure how long the restaurant has been there, 25 years maybe, but it carries the vibe of a very classic American-style fine dining place.  It's not over-the-top gaudy or showy, not boisterous or pretentious, just simple, beautiful and elegant.  The food is not deconstructed or petit or very fancily plated.  It simply is what I imagine fine dining used to be.

I should have known something was wrong when I was able to secure a last minute reservation for 6 on New Years Eve.

They have a full bar there but I would recommend sticking to beer. Their cocktails aren't as inexpensive as they should be and are sometimes weak. Their beer selection is pretty good though and they sell pitchers which is always a plus in my book. During a commercial break, be sure to observe the people around you.

D: At last our pizza came, and Exchequer serves the kind without the pizza sauce on top, so this pizza is just cheesy goodness. The crust was baked well and the cheese was yummy. Exchequer allows you to design your own pizza, so there are many toppings. You can even go",4,Positive
